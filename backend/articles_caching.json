        "text": "You may have heard that bitcoin\u2014excuse me, blockchain\u2014is boring these days. I disagree; the real drama comes after the crash. One recent true story is that of a 30-year-old crypto CEO, (apparently) dead of complications from Crohn\u2019s disease while volunteering at an Indian orphanage, who leaves behind a riddle of false identities, illicit side ventures, and $100 million in missing cryptocurrency. Now there's a movie I\u2019d pay to see.\n\nInstead, Hollywood has given us Crypto, a product of headier times, when the bitcoin bubble still held air. Like many bad investments of that era, the movie hitched itself to the trending topic and prayed the trend was upward. Crypto, directed by John Stalberg Jr., had the makings of a blockbuster, with an all-star-ish cast including Kurt Russell, Alexis Bledel, and that other Hemsworth brother. It was released unceremoniously last Friday, direct-to-stream.\n\nBeau Knapp plays Morton, a bank compliance officer whose \u201cpatriotic\u201d adherence to money-laundering laws gets him kicked out of HQ in New York. Relocated to the local branch in his upstate hometown, Morton finds the place beset by modernity. The gentrifiers have arrived; there\u2019s an art gallery, with an opioid-abusing proprietor. A cold snap has taken out his father's potato farm. The liquor store owner hawks initial coin offerings, letting townies steal six-packs while he mines crypto in the storage room. (He\u2019s pulling $500 a day.)\n\nYes, Crypto is full of references to cryptocurrency. Some of them, like Bledel\u2019s grousing about a bitcoin ATM, are even charming. But the movie isn\u2019t really about crypto. Instead, it\u2019s preoccupied with eulogizing the loss of hometown innocence, following a set of tired themes\u2014drugs, crime, climate change, foreigners. (As the heroin-addled gallerist, a corrupt townie herself, puts it just before betraying her Russian mobster beau: \u201cLife\u2019s not simple anymore,\u201d anywhere.) Bitcoin just serves as a handy meme to thread those social ills into the semblance of a plot.\n\nHollywood\u2019s take on crypto wasn\u2019t expected to be nuanced. What\u2019s surprising about this take is that it's not entirely off-target. Crypto brings me back to the chatter about bitcoin peak hype, when it slotted easily alongside other dinner-table topics, like Trump and Russian hackers. What did we mean when we talked about bitcoin circa Thanksgiving 2017? It was that thing nobody quite understood but couldn\u2019t help bringing up. Sure, it might\u2019ve seemed a little tainted, a window into a world of decadence and crime, but somehow so-and-so\u2019s respectable cousin was making a killing. Maybe it was time to jump in.\n\nThe filmmakers suggest that our bitcoin gossip was code for latent anxiety, universally felt. Crypto imagines mainstream America diving into the fever dream and stepping away forever corrupted. By having the gangsters and the money launderers appear at the upstate farm, Crypto does what big screen thrillers are supposed to do\u2014it strips away our vague allusions and makes those fears real. The result may be clich\u00e9, but perhaps so were the conversations.\n\nThe question is whether our perspective has evolved. When the trailer came out in March, some bristled at the dark web kitsch; crypto enthusiasts had hoped Hollywood might present a new narrative, where blockchain was equated with privacy and liberation. That\u2019s silly\u2014not because of Hollywood\u2019s limitations, but because the popular narrative around crypto hasn\u2019t been given reason to budge. Blockchain hasn\u2019t changed the world yet, at least in a way anyone has noticed. It\u2019s not even making anyone especially rich. The movie simply sticks to the closest available truth.\n\nStill, it would have been nice to see a little more imagination. Flickers of prescience feel accidental. Earl, the liquor store ICO shill, mumbles about a conspiracy among the banks to buy up crypto \u201cbecause they can\u2019t control it.\u201d That turned out to be true, just not in the way they intended it. Could Crypto have foreseen, with bitcoin headed for the mainstream, that women might be a more visible part of it? Perhaps Bledel might\u2019ve been spotted running a rig or writing some code. Nope, but she does serve to fulfill a redemption narrative for a minor (male) character. (This movie lacks a single woman who does not end up a sacrificial lamb.)\n\nIt\u2019s that sort of thing that makes Crypto, while thoughtful about cryptocurrency, a mess of a movie. For its comment-on-America pretense, this is a boy's-club hacking film so thinly constructed that even Morton himself comments upon each improbable twist, \u201cThis is insane.\u201d Informants inform and then, like certain cicadas reaching their 17th year, promptly die. Kurt Russell could\u2019ve been replaced by a cardboard cutout; he appears for a few minutes to squint and scowl and look very dirty (potato farmer, remember). There are sawn-off tongues, greased gangsters who gawk from afar, videos from the dead bearing the passphrase to private key encryption (to a secure USB containing nebulous \u201cevidence\u201d). A crinkled note from the mobsters reads \"COPS = RIP.\" If only the director could have just let this movie be funny.\n\nEventually, a mobster or two gets offed, and Morton doffs his jacket to return to the land and hoe potatoes with Dad. The mining rigs keep humming in town\u2014and it\u2019s true that, somewhere, off-camera, they still are.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

            "text": "You may have heard that bitcoin\u2014excuse me, blockchain\u2014is boring these days. I disagree; the real drama comes after the crash. One recent true story is that of a 30-year-old crypto CEO, (apparently) dead of complications from Crohn\u2019s disease while volunteering at an Indian orphanage, who leaves behind a riddle of false identities, illicit side ventures, and $100 million in missing cryptocurrency. Now there's a movie I\u2019d pay to see.\n\nInstead, Hollywood has given us Crypto, a product of headier times, when the bitcoin bubble still held air. Like many bad investments of that era, the movie hitched itself to the trending topic and prayed the trend was upward. Crypto, directed by John Stalberg Jr., had the makings of a blockbuster, with an all-star-ish cast including Kurt Russell, Alexis Bledel, and that other Hemsworth brother. It was released unceremoniously last Friday, direct-to-stream.\n\nBeau Knapp plays Morton, a bank compliance officer whose \u201cpatriotic\u201d adherence to money-laundering laws gets him kicked out of HQ in New York. Relocated to the local branch in his upstate hometown, Morton finds the place beset by modernity. The gentrifiers have arrived; there\u2019s an art gallery, with an opioid-abusing proprietor. A cold snap has taken out his father's potato farm. The liquor store owner hawks initial coin offerings, letting townies steal six-packs while he mines crypto in the storage room. (He\u2019s pulling $500 a day.)\n\nYes, Crypto is full of references to cryptocurrency. Some of them, like Bledel\u2019s grousing about a bitcoin ATM, are even charming. But the movie isn\u2019t really about crypto. Instead, it\u2019s preoccupied with eulogizing the loss of hometown innocence, following a set of tired themes\u2014drugs, crime, climate change, foreigners. (As the heroin-addled gallerist, a corrupt townie herself, puts it just before betraying her Russian mobster beau: \u201cLife\u2019s not simple anymore,\u201d anywhere.) Bitcoin just serves as a handy meme to thread those social ills into the semblance of a plot.\n\nHollywood\u2019s take on crypto wasn\u2019t expected to be nuanced. What\u2019s surprising about this take is that it's not entirely off-target. Crypto brings me back to the chatter about bitcoin peak hype, when it slotted easily alongside other dinner-table topics, like Trump and Russian hackers. What did we mean when we talked about bitcoin circa Thanksgiving 2017? It was that thing nobody quite understood but couldn\u2019t help bringing up. Sure, it might\u2019ve seemed a little tainted, a window into a world of decadence and crime, but somehow so-and-so\u2019s respectable cousin was making a killing. Maybe it was time to jump in.\n\nThe filmmakers suggest that our bitcoin gossip was code for latent anxiety, universally felt. Crypto imagines mainstream America diving into the fever dream and stepping away forever corrupted. By having the gangsters and the money launderers appear at the upstate farm, Crypto does what big screen thrillers are supposed to do\u2014it strips away our vague allusions and makes those fears real. The result may be clich\u00e9, but perhaps so were the conversations.\n\nThe question is whether our perspective has evolved. When the trailer came out in March, some bristled at the dark web kitsch; crypto enthusiasts had hoped Hollywood might present a new narrative, where blockchain was equated with privacy and liberation. That\u2019s silly\u2014not because of Hollywood\u2019s limitations, but because the popular narrative around crypto hasn\u2019t been given reason to budge. Blockchain hasn\u2019t changed the world yet, at least in a way anyone has noticed. It\u2019s not even making anyone especially rich. The movie simply sticks to the closest available truth.\n\nStill, it would have been nice to see a little more imagination. Flickers of prescience feel accidental. Earl, the liquor store ICO shill, mumbles about a conspiracy among the banks to buy up crypto \u201cbecause they can\u2019t control it.\u201d That turned out to be true, just not in the way they intended it. Could Crypto have foreseen, with bitcoin headed for the mainstream, that women might be a more visible part of it? Perhaps Bledel might\u2019ve been spotted running a rig or writing some code. Nope, but she does serve to fulfill a redemption narrative for a minor (male) character. (This movie lacks a single woman who does not end up a sacrificial lamb.)\n\nIt\u2019s that sort of thing that makes Crypto, while thoughtful about cryptocurrency, a mess of a movie. For its comment-on-America pretense, this is a boy's-club hacking film so thinly constructed that even Morton himself comments upon each improbable twist, \u201cThis is insane.\u201d Informants inform and then, like certain cicadas reaching their 17th year, promptly die. Kurt Russell could\u2019ve been replaced by a cardboard cutout; he appears for a few minutes to squint and scowl and look very dirty (potato farmer, remember). There are sawn-off tongues, greased gangsters who gawk from afar, videos from the dead bearing the passphrase to private key encryption (to a secure USB containing nebulous \u201cevidence\u201d). A crinkled note from the mobsters reads \"COPS = RIP.\" If only the director could have just let this movie be funny.\n\nEventually, a mobster or two gets offed, and Morton doffs his jacket to return to the land and hoe potatoes with Dad. The mining rigs keep humming in town\u2014and it\u2019s true that, somewhere, off-camera, they still are.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

        "text": "Initial coin offerings have gotten a bad rap\u2014in many cases, deservedly so. Sure, there were blockchain projects with sound dreams and solid business plans. But as the bitcoin bubble swelled in late 2017, ICOs became synonymous with predation: get-rich-quick schemes that involved taking money from anyone who was willing, in return for worthless crypto tokens.\n\nSince then, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been trying to clean up the mess. The rules are vague, but this much has become clear: Most ICOs are securities offerings, and require all the protections and disclosures of selling stocks. That basically takes them off the table for ordinary investors. Blockchain startups now typically fund themselves with sales of shares (or tokens) to so-called accredited investors, institutions, and wealthy individuals.\n\nBut now one blockchain startup thinks it\u2019s found a way to get you and me involved again in token sales\u2014with the SEC\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cI hate the term ICO,\u201d says Muneeb Ali, cofounder and CEO of Blockstack, which is building a platform for decentralized apps. Last week, the company filed an application with the SEC to sell its tokens, called Stacks, under an exemption called Regulation A+. The pathway came into being as part of the JOBS Act passed by Congress in 2012, and allows businesses to raise $50 million each year from ordinary investors. Blockstack believes that, if approved by the SEC, it would be the first to use the exemption to sell a crypto token.\n\nTucked in the filing was a disclosure about another Blockstack investor: Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university\u2019s endowment. It\u2019s listed alongside two other investors that together hold a stake valued at about $11 million, purchased in an earlier token sale (Harvard\u2019s exact share wasn\u2019t disclosed). Though a few big institutions, including Yale and two Virginia pension plans, have invested in crypto-focused funds, Harvard\u2019s involvement is unusual in that it appears to have taken a direct interest in the tokens of a blockchain network.

            "text": "Initial coin offerings have gotten a bad rap\u2014in many cases, deservedly so. Sure, there were blockchain projects with sound dreams and solid business plans. But as the bitcoin bubble swelled in late 2017, ICOs became synonymous with predation: get-rich-quick schemes that involved taking money from anyone who was willing, in return for worthless crypto tokens.\n\nSince then, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been trying to clean up the mess. The rules are vague, but this much has become clear: Most ICOs are securities offerings, and require all the protections and disclosures of selling stocks. That basically takes them off the table for ordinary investors. Blockchain startups now typically fund themselves with sales of shares (or tokens) to so-called accredited investors, institutions, and wealthy individuals.\n\nBut now one blockchain startup thinks it\u2019s found a way to get you and me involved again in token sales\u2014with the SEC\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cI hate the term ICO,\u201d says Muneeb Ali, cofounder and CEO of Blockstack, which is building a platform for decentralized apps. Last week, the company filed an application with the SEC to sell its tokens, called Stacks, under an exemption called Regulation A+. The pathway came into being as part of the JOBS Act passed by Congress in 2012, and allows businesses to raise $50 million each year from ordinary investors. Blockstack believes that, if approved by the SEC, it would be the first to use the exemption to sell a crypto token.\n\nTucked in the filing was a disclosure about another Blockstack investor: Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university\u2019s endowment. It\u2019s listed alongside two other investors that together hold a stake valued at about $11 million, purchased in an earlier token sale (Harvard\u2019s exact share wasn\u2019t disclosed). Though a few big institutions, including Yale and two Virginia pension plans, have invested in crypto-focused funds, Harvard\u2019s involvement is unusual in that it appears to have taken a direct interest in the tokens of a blockchain network. Harvard Management Company declined to comment.\n\nWhy look to ordinary investors when you\u2019ve already got Harvard signed on? The answer relates to how decentralized projects grow.\n\nToken sales are a necessary evil in the blockchain world.

That made it an appealing coin in which to park funds between trades, even though the coin has been dogged by hacks and rumors of fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn what may be the final nail in Tether\u2019s coffin, Leticia James, New York attorney general, concluded yesterday that \u201cthe operators of the \u2018Bitfinex\u2019 trading platform, who also control the \u2018tether\u2019 virtual currency, have engaged in a cover-up to hide the apparent loss of $850 million dollars of co-mingled client and corporate funds.\u201d In other words, the money supposedly backing Tether\u2019s coins simply isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s believed that the money has been stolen or laundered through a secondary firm iFinex used to hold them called Crypto Capital, though the disappearance of a near-billion dollars was not disclosed to anyone investing their funds in the coin.\n\nJames obtained an injunction from the New York State Supreme Court, which, among other demands placed on the company and its founders, bars them from continuing to disseminate Tether.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission hit the firm with subpoenas back in 2017, and traders spotted the names of iFinex executives included among the leaked Paradise Papers. But concerns that Tether may not be operating in good financial faith extend beyond the coin itself. Research indicates Tether was used to directly manipulate the price of the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and the value of many of the most popular coins tends to rise and fall with the price of Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Bloomberg reported:\n\nCorrespondence between a senior Bitfinex executive and Crypto Capital included in the attorney general\u2019s complaint suggests the exchange was under immense pressure in October to gain access to funds amid a spike in client withdrawal requests. \u201cPlease understand all this could be extremely dangerous for everybody, the entire crypto community,\u201d the executive wrote, according to the attorney general. \u201cBTC could tank to below 1k if we don\u2019t act quickly.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is down by around 5.1 percent.\n\nBitfinex has vehemently denied the AG\u2019s findings. \u201cBoth Bitfinex and Tether are financially strong \u2013 full stop\u201d the company wrote in a statement, claiming \u201cwe have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, in the past year Tether\u2019s value has fluctuated between $1.03 and $0.96. Following the AG\u2019s announcement, it sunk 1.6 percent, as did all but 12 of the top 100 most-traded virtual currencies. According to CNBC, the digital currency market lost $10 billion worth of value within the first hour of the New York AG\u2019s announcement. Among those that saw their value increase was USD Coin\u2014another \u201cstablecoin\u201d making almost identical claims to Tether.\n\n[Bloomberg]",

But, they\u2019re also warning the recent Tether drama could turn Bitcoin bearish again over the short term.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, Bitcoin would mirror 2015 market cycles that led to a bull market lasting two years, independent research firm Delphi Digital reports.\n\n\u201cIn our [\u2026] report that we released in early December, we made a call that Bitcoin will bottom by the end of Q1 2019,\u201d said Delphi Digital. \u201cWe continue to stand by that call, we believe Bitcoin has bottomed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin continues to trade relatively in line with its prior boom-bust cycle of 2013-2015. This period was also characterized by an extended bear market with multiple relief rallies on the way to lower lows,\u201d added Delphi Digital.\n\nBitcoin holders didn\u2019t cash out during recent rallies\n\nDelphi Digital sorts Bitcoins by the last time they were moved with data called \u201cUnspent Transaction Output\u201d (UXTO). The length of time Bitcoin stays dormant is referred to its \u201cUXTO age.\u201d\n\nAs cryptocurrency activity increases, the cumulative UXTO age of the network falls. Conversely, if it rises, one can infer less Bitcoin investors are \u201cholding\u201d their digital assets.\n\nDelphi Digital\u2019s data shows the amount of people holding Bitcoin for longer than one year has steadily grown.\n\n\u201cIf the December 2018 low holds, Bitcoin\u2018s bottom will have come almost a year to the day after its late 2017 peak. BTC\u2019s January 2015 price bottom was around 405 days following its December 2013 peak,\u201d said Delphi Digital. \u201cThis rough timeline aligns with our UTXO analysis.\u201d\n\nThe report explained that holders weren\u2019t really looking to profit from Bitcoin\u2018s recent rally that sent its price over $5,000 for the first time in months.\n\n\u201cAs of April 23, 61.1 percent of Bitcoin has not moved in over a year,\u201d said Delphi Digital. \u201cThis \u2018one-year-plus\u2019 holder rate was 52 percent at the end of November, 57 percent at the end of January, and 60.3 percent a week into March.\u201d\n\nThis shows consistent growth in the percentage of holders who keep their Bitcoin between one and two years, which indicates those who purchased Bitcoin in late 2017 and early 2018 have kept their investments, despite the market tanking.\n\nDelphi Digital expects to see more holding Bitcoin for at least two years by late June. Interestingly, the firm says the same thing happened when money flooded the cryptocurrency market in 2017.\n\n\u201cFollowing the prolonged leveling-off period in older bands, where we saw the few residual long-term holders finally act on their intention to sell, we\u2019re starting to see very gradual accumulation in both the \u2018three-to-five\u2019 year band and the \u2018five-year-plus\u2019 band,\u201d said Delphi Digital.\n\nNews and sentiment are key factors in Bitcoin bull markets\n\nThe report placed Bitcoin atop a list of the best-performing assets of this year, which includes gold and oil investments, as well as various exchange-traded funds.\n\nStill, Delphi Digital co-founder Anil Lulla told Hard Fork that sentiment and news played a huge role in the chaos of the 2017 market. These factors will most likely continue to cause short-term market moves (especially when a bull market returns).\n\n\u201cI still believe news will sway this market in the near term given how young and immature it still is,\u201d said Lulla. \u201cFor example, look at a token like ENJ which went up over 800 percent in a few weeks based off a Samsung partnership rumor which was then confirmed.\u201d\n\nLulla noted he wasn\u2019t surprised to see the Bitcoin market suddenly drop after news broke that New York\u2019s attorney general had it in for mainstay stablecoin Tether.\n\nDelphi Digital told clients it detected a sizable amount of user-sent funds from Bitfinex due to the uncertainty.\n\nIt said it was unclear how many more will sell their holdings entirely, rather than simply transfer them to another exchange.\n\nStill, Lulla highlighted the market had reacted more to the positive news. The negative Tether story didn\u2019t create the panic most people expected.\n\n\u201cObviously, this isn\u2019t apples-to-apples, given the significant difference in liquidity and total volume of these two scenarios \u2013 just trying to illustrate that people within the market will continue to trade the \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 mantra,\u201d Lulla told Hard Fork.\n\nIn the long-term, Delphi Digital says the Tether drama will likely cause a \u201chealthy wash-out\u201d of suspicious actors from the space.\n\n\u201cWe are not making any conclusions about this case as this is not our area of expertise, nor are we assuming that Bitfinex and Tether fall into the \u2018bad actor\u2019 category,\u201d said the firm. \u201cWe simply believe the seriousness of this legal action will accelerate the level of scrutiny regulators impose as they attempt to expel malicious actors from this nascent market.\u201d\n\nYou can read Delphi Digital\u2019s report in full here.\n\nDid you know?

But, they\u2019re also warning the recent Tether drama could turn Bitcoin bearish again over the short term.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, Bitcoin would mirror 2015 market cycles that led to a bull market lasting two years, independent research firm Delphi Digital reports.\n\n\u201cIn our [\u2026] report that we released in early December, we made a call that Bitcoin will bottom by the end of Q1 2019,\u201d said Delphi Digital. \u201cWe continue to stand by that call, we believe Bitcoin has bottomed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin continues to trade relatively in line with its prior boom-bust cycle of 2013-2015. This period was also characterized by an extended bear market with multiple relief rallies on the way to lower lows,\u201d added Delphi Digital.\n\nBitcoin holders didn\u2019t cash out during recent rallies\n\nDelphi Digital sorts Bitcoins by the last time they were moved with data called \u201cUnspent Transaction Output\u201d (UXTO). The length of time Bitcoin stays dormant is referred to its \u201cUXTO age.\u201d\n\nAs cryptocurrency activity increases, the cumulative UXTO age of the network falls. Conversely, if it rises, one can infer less Bitcoin investors are \u201cholding\u201d their digital assets.\n\nDelphi Digital\u2019s data shows the amount of people holding Bitcoin for longer than one year has steadily grown.\n\n\u201cIf the December 2018 low holds, Bitcoin\u2018s bottom will have come almost a year to the day after its late 2017 peak. BTC\u2019s January 2015 price bottom was around 405 days following its December 2013 peak,\u201d said Delphi Digital. \u201cThis rough timeline aligns with our UTXO analysis.\u201d\n\nThe report explained that holders weren\u2019t really looking to profit from Bitcoin\u2018s recent rally that sent its price over $5,000 for the first time in months.\n\n\u201cAs of April 23, 61.1 percent of Bitcoin has not moved in over a year,\u201d said Delphi Digital. \u201cThis \u2018one-year-plus\u2019 holder rate was 52 percent at the end of November, 57 percent at the end of January, and 60.3 percent a week into March.\u201d\n\nThis shows consistent growth in the percentage of holders who keep their Bitcoin between one and two years, which indicates those who purchased Bitcoin in late 2017 and early 2018 have kept their investments, despite the market tanking.\n\nDelphi Digital expects to see more holding Bitcoin for at least two years by late June. Interestingly, the firm says the same thing happened when money flooded the cryptocurrency market in 2017.\n\n\u201cFollowing the prolonged leveling-off period in older bands, where we saw the few residual long-term holders finally act on their intention to sell, we\u2019re starting to see very gradual accumulation in both the \u2018three-to-five\u2019 year band and the \u2018five-year-plus\u2019 band,\u201d said Delphi Digital.\n\nNews and sentiment are key factors in Bitcoin bull markets\n\nThe report placed Bitcoin atop a list of the best-performing assets of this year, which includes gold and oil investments, as well as various exchange-traded funds.\n\nStill, Delphi Digital co-founder Anil Lulla told Hard Fork that sentiment and news played a huge role in the chaos of the 2017 market. These factors will most likely continue to cause short-term market moves (especially when a bull market returns).\n\n\u201cI still believe news will sway this market in the near term given how young and immature it still is,\u201d said Lulla. \u201cFor example, look at a token like ENJ which went up over 800 percent in a few weeks based off a Samsung partnership rumor which was then confirmed.\u201d\n\nLulla noted he wasn\u2019t surprised to see the Bitcoin market suddenly drop after news broke that New York\u2019s attorney general had it in for mainstay stablecoin Tether.\n\nDelphi Digital told clients it detected a sizable amount of user-sent funds from Bitfinex due to the uncertainty.\n\nIt said it was unclear how many more will sell their holdings entirely, rather than simply transfer them to another exchange.\n\nStill, Lulla highlighted the market had reacted more to the positive news. The negative Tether story didn\u2019t create the panic most people expected.\n\n\u201cObviously, this isn\u2019t apples-to-apples, given the significant difference in liquidity and total volume of these two scenarios \u2013 just trying to illustrate that people within the market will continue to trade the \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 mantra,\u201d Lulla told Hard Fork.\n\nIn the long-term, Delphi Digital says the Tether drama will likely cause a \u201chealthy wash-out\u201d of suspicious actors from the space.\n\n\u201cWe are not making any conclusions about this case as this is not our area of expertise, nor are we assuming that Bitfinex and Tether fall into the \u2018bad actor\u2019 category,\u201d said the firm. \u201cWe simply believe the seriousness of this legal action will accelerate the level of scrutiny regulators impose as they attempt to expel malicious actors from this nascent market.\u201d\n\nYou can read Delphi Digital\u2019s report in full here.\n\nDid you know? Hard Fork has its own stage at TNW2019, our tech conference in Amsterdam. Check it out.",

        "text": "How German and US authorities took down the owners of darknet drug emporium Wall Street Market\n\nThe major darknet marketplace known as the Wall Street Market has been seized and its alleged operators arrested in a joint operation between European and U.S. authorities. Millions in cash, cryptocurrency and other assets were collected, and the market shut down. How investigators tied these anonymity-obsessed individuals to the illegal activities is instructive.\n\nThe three men accused of running Wall Street Market (WSM), one of the larger hidden service markets operating via the Tor network, are all German citizens: Tibo Lousee, Jonathan Kalla and Klaus-Martin Frost; several vendors from the market have also been charged, including one who sold meth on it by the kilogram.\n\nThe investigation has been ongoing since 2017, but was pushed to a crisis by the apparent attempt in April by WSM\u2019s operators to execute an exit scam. By suddenly removing all the cryptocurrency held in escrow and otherwise stored under their authority, the alleged owners stood to gain some $11 million if they were able to convert the coins.\n\nUntil recently, Wall Street Market was a bustling bazaar for illegal goods, including dangerous drugs like fentanyl and physical items like fake documents. It had more than a million user accounts, some 5,400 vendors and tens of thousands of items available for purchase. It has grown as other darknet marketplaces have been cornered and shut down, driving users and sellers to a dwindling pool of smaller platforms.\n\nWhether the owners sought simply to parley this growth to a quick cash grab or whether they sensed the law about to knock down their door, the exit scam was undertaken on April 16.\n\nThis action prompted investigators in the U.S. and Germany, and Europol, to take action, as this exit scam marked not only an opportunity for investigators to gather and observe fresh evidence of the trio\u2019s alleged crimes, but waiting much longer might let them go to ground and launder their virtual goods.\n\nThe DOJ complaint details the means by which the three administrators of the site were linked to it, despite their attempts to anonymize their access. It isn\u2019t unprecedented stuff, but it\u2019s always interesting to read through the step-by-step forensics that lead to charges, since it can be very difficult to tie real-world actors to virtual entities.\n\nFor Frost, it was an unstable VPN connection, plus some sleuthing by the German federal police, the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA:\n\nThe WSM administrators accessed the WSM infrastructure primarily through the use of two VPN service providers. On occasion, VPN Provider #1 connection would cease, but because that specific administrator continued to access the WSM infrastructure, that administrator\u2019s access exposed the true IP address of the administrator The individual utilizing the above-referenced IP address to connect to the WSM infrastructure used a device called a UMTS-stick (aka surfstick) [i.e. a dongle for mobile internet access]. This UMTS-stick was registered to a suspected fictitious name. The BKA executed multiple surveillance measures to electronically locate the specific UMTS-stick. BKA\u2019s surveillance team identified that, between February 5 and 7, 2019, the specific UMTS-stick was used at a residence of Lousee in Kleve, Northrhine-Westphalia (Germany), and his place of employment, an information technology company where Lousee is employed as a computer programmer. Lousee was later found in possession of a UMTS stick.\n\nSome other circumstantial evidence also tied Lousee to the operation, such as similar login names, mentions of drugs and cryptocurrencies, and so on. (\u201cBased on my training and experience as an investigator, I am aware that \u2018420\u2019 is a reference to marijuana,\u201d writes the special agent who authored the complaint.)\n\nKalla\u2019s VPN held strong, but the metadata betrayed him:\n\nAn IP address assigned to the home of this individual (the account for the IP address was registered in the name of the suspect\u2019s mother) accessed VPN Provider #2 within similar rough time frames as administrator-only components of the WSM server infrastructure were accessed by VPN Provider #2.\n\nHardly a hole in one, but Kalla later admitted he was the user agent in question. This is a good example of how a VPN can and can\u2019t protect you against government snooping. It may disguise your IP to certain systems, but anyone with a bird\u2019s-eye view can see the obvious correlation between one connection and another. It won\u2019t hold up in court on its own, but if the investigators are good it won\u2019t have to.\n\nFrost, the third administrator, required a more subtle approach, but ultimately it was again poor opsec; this time an unwise cross-contamination of his cryptographic and cryptocurrency accounts:\n\nThe PGP public key for [WSM administrative account] \u2018TheOne\u2019 is the same as the PGP public key for another moniker on [another hidden service] Hansa Market, \u2018dudebuy.\u2019 As described below, a financial transaction connected to a virtual currency wallet used by FROST was linked to \u2018dudebuy.\u2019 [The BKA] located the PGP public key for \u2018TheOne\u2019 in the WSM database, referred to as \u2018Public Key 1\u2019. Public Key 1 was the PGP public key for \u2018dudebuy.\u2019 The \u2018refund wallet\u2019 for \u2018dudebuy\u2019 was Wallet 2. Wallet 2 was a source of funds for a Bitcoin transaction\u2026 Records obtained from the Bitcoin Payment Processing Company revealed buyer information for that Bitcoin transaction as \u2018Martin Frost,\u2019 using the email address klaus-martin.frost@\u2026\n\nEssentially A is B, and B is C, so A is C. This little deductive trick is handy, but bitcoin wallets used by Frost were also identified through analysis by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which, if you didn\u2019t know, has \u201ca highly trained, skilled and committed cyber unit.\u201d\n\nThe United States Postal Inspection Service learned, through its analysis of Blockchain transactions and information gleaned from the proprietary software described above, that the funds from Wallet 2 were first transferred to Wallet 1, and then \u201cmixed\u201d by a commercial service; mixing services is described above at paragraph 4.m. Through thorough analysis, the United States Postal Inspection Service was able to \u201cde-mix\u201d the flow of transactions, to eventually ascertain that the money from Wallets 1 and 2 ultimately paid FROST\u2019s account at the Product Services Company.\n\nHere the blockchain\u2019s indelible record clearly worked against Frost. Wallet 1, by the way, handled thousands of bitcoins during its use in association with another darknet marketplace, German Plaza Market \u2014 which the three charged today also allegedly ran and shut down via an exit scam.\n\nIn addition to the administrators, some vendors and others associated with the site were charged. They were identified via more traditional means and their activities linked to the market in such a way that defense seems a lost cause. The record for a Brazilian man who operated as a dealer and as a sort of representative for WSM on Reddit and forums is an interesting study in the web of suggestive accounts and names that produce a damning, if circumstantial, depiction of a person\u2019s associations and interests, from the banal to the criminal.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution of these defendants shows that even the smallest mistake will allow us to figure out a cybercriminal\u2019s true identity,\u201d said U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott in the DOJ press release. \u201cWe are on the hunt for even the tiniest of breadcrumbs.\u201d\n\nCases against the alleged criminals will be held in multiple locations and under multiple authorities \u2014 it\u2019s safe to say this is just the beginning of a long, complicated process for everyone involved.",

But the technology spreads far beyond that, and presidential candidate Andrew Yang says now's the time for clearer government rules to encourage its development in the US.\n\nYang, a tech entrepreneur and now one of at least 18 Democratic challengers to Donald Trump, is far from the frontrunner for an election that's still a year and a half away. But the fact that he's weighing in at all shows that cryptocurrency and related technology, like blockchain, isn't just an obsession of crypto-anarchists who want a high-tech alternative to a safe full of Krugerrands.\n\nIf Yang gets his way, cryptocurrencies could become more useful and move beyond early problems like initial coin offering (ICO) scams and criminal payment uses.

        "authors": [],
        "publishDate": "2019-05-09 00:00:00",
        "text": "The Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Cryptocurrencies were primarily designed to facilitate faster and more secure financial transactions over the web. They were meant to make the world a better place. However, there are worrying studies that show that the rise of Bitcoin alone could increase the world\u2019s global warming levels by two degrees in a span of just 2 decades.\n\nThis is because this increase in the use of Bitcoin places huge demands on the world\u2019s energy system. As a result, astronomical amounts of carbon emissions are given off, which consequently cause a global warming effect. It is inevitable that the continued growth of Bitcoin would lead to a two-degree increase in global warming, which is definitely not good news for the environment.\n\nWhere do Bitcoins come from?\n\nPut simply, Bitcoins are born when people mine them online with their computers. They are very expensive to produce. Computers mine Bitcoins by solving complex math equations, and by doing so they suck up a lot of electricity. The amount of electricity used to mine a single Bitcoin is relatively equivalent to the amount of power a single house uses for months. Plus, Bitcoins can only be 21 million in total meaning it takes a lot of time and energy to produce just a single unit.\n\nScientists have done a comparison of the number of emissions by mining computers to that of transportation, housing, and food, which are considered the main contributors to climate change. It has been determined that cryptocurrency mining produces enough emissions to warrant inclusion to the list.\n\nBecause the Bitcoin business is volatile, predicting its future is tricky. No one can tell where its value will stand at a few years from now. It has also become so competitive now that sometimes, the amount of money it takes to produce it is more than its actual value.\n\nThe more difficult the equation a computer solves, the more energy it uses. For this reason, the value of a Bitcoin could increase over time as equations become more complex. However, things could also take an opposite twist when mining technology improves in efficiency in the future resulting in lower prices and less energy consumption.\n\nHow it accelerates Global Warming.\n\nSince more complicated equations consume more energy, with the increasing complexity of Bitcoin equations, more energy is being spent to produce fewer coins. As more and more computing power is delegated to Bitcoin mining, the energy being released compounds upon itself, accelerating the effects of global warming.\n\nMany crypto companies and blockchain based organizations are looking into this environmental issue with an intention of coming up with a solution. They want to develop a way of sustainable supply chains and decarbonizing energy systems. This has proven to be a hard task since the potential energy uptake and carbon emissions given off from mining bitcoins are directly against the vision of the technology.\n\nIs there a solution to this Bitcoin issue?\n\nSo far, only speculations have arisen. It is dangerous to assume that bitcoin mining will be significantly more efficient in the future. It is a 50:50 scenario because no one really can tell how much more powerful computers of the next decade will be, and if they will be able to handle the equations much faster. Therefore, achieving this speculated efficiency is something that may or may not happen, and that puts all of us in a dangerous position.\n\nOne of the main proposal being put forward is the regulation of crypto mining throughout the world. Yes, cryptocurrency is untraceable, but governments should take charge and regulate mining them because of their high energy demands- says Day Translations\n\nAnother solution being proposed is currency-based. The fact that bitcoin is costly in terms of the computing power and work needed for running is what makes it undefeated. An obvious solution, therefore, is to keep improving the existing protocol to further improve efficiencies.\n\nAnd everyday innovators are taking up this task to do just that. Plus, computer chips also continue to advance by the day, improving the efficiency of computation in relation to power intake. However, the main downside of this approach is as long as there is money to be made, more miners will continue flocking the Bitcoin scene and in return, more power will be consumed just as before.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms have also experimented with alternative protocols which consume way less energy. Such algorithms could potentially eliminate the energy consuming process of mining while at the same time recording transactions. The fact that a number of brilliant minds in the industry have realized the problem and are actively working on such algorithms shows a bright future.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBitcoin is not the only crypto out in the world today. It is just the most popular one when compared to the rest. There are plenty of more crypto types that require far less energy and less complex equations to solve. In its current state, Bitcoin mining is slowly but surely proving harmful to the environment. If the trend continues, and if a solution is not found soon, the effects will start to be felt within as little as a decade. All stakeholders should strive to come up with solutions that will help mitigate the overall accelerating effects that Bitcoin mining is having on global warming.",

            "text": "The Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Cryptocurrencies were primarily designed to facilitate faster and more secure financial transactions over the web. They were meant to make the world a better place. However, there are worrying studies that show that the rise of Bitcoin alone could increase the world\u2019s global warming levels by two degrees in a span of just 2 decades.\n\nThis is because this increase in the use of Bitcoin places huge demands on the world\u2019s energy system. As a result, astronomical amounts of carbon emissions are given off, which consequently cause a global warming effect. It is inevitable that the continued growth of Bitcoin would lead to a two-degree increase in global warming, which is definitely not good news for the environment.\n\nWhere do Bitcoins come from?\n\nPut simply, Bitcoins are born when people mine them online with their computers. They are very expensive to produce. Computers mine Bitcoins by solving complex math equations, and by doing so they suck up a lot of electricity. The amount of electricity used to mine a single Bitcoin is relatively equivalent to the amount of power a single house uses for months. Plus, Bitcoins can only be 21 million in total meaning it takes a lot of time and energy to produce just a single unit.\n\nScientists have done a comparison of the number of emissions by mining computers to that of transportation, housing, and food, which are considered the main contributors to climate change. It has been determined that cryptocurrency mining produces enough emissions to warrant inclusion to the list.\n\nBecause the Bitcoin business is volatile, predicting its future is tricky. No one can tell where its value will stand at a few years from now. It has also become so competitive now that sometimes, the amount of money it takes to produce it is more than its actual value.\n\nThe more difficult the equation a computer solves, the more energy it uses. For this reason, the value of a Bitcoin could increase over time as equations become more complex. However, things could also take an opposite twist when mining technology improves in efficiency in the future resulting in lower prices and less energy consumption.\n\nHow it accelerates Global Warming.\n\nSince more complicated equations consume more energy, with the increasing complexity of Bitcoin equations, more energy is being spent to produce fewer coins. As more and more computing power is delegated to Bitcoin mining, the energy being released compounds upon itself, accelerating the effects of global warming.\n\nMany crypto companies and blockchain based organizations are looking into this environmental issue with an intention of coming up with a solution. They want to develop a way of sustainable supply chains and decarbonizing energy systems. This has proven to be a hard task since the potential energy uptake and carbon emissions given off from mining bitcoins are directly against the vision of the technology.\n\nIs there a solution to this Bitcoin issue?\n\nSo far, only speculations have arisen. It is dangerous to assume that bitcoin mining will be significantly more efficient in the future. It is a 50:50 scenario because no one really can tell how much more powerful computers of the next decade will be, and if they will be able to handle the equations much faster. Therefore, achieving this speculated efficiency is something that may or may not happen, and that puts all of us in a dangerous position.\n\nOne of the main proposal being put forward is the regulation of crypto mining throughout the world. Yes, cryptocurrency is untraceable, but governments should take charge and regulate mining them because of their high energy demands- says Day Translations\n\nAnother solution being proposed is currency-based. The fact that bitcoin is costly in terms of the computing power and work needed for running is what makes it undefeated. An obvious solution, therefore, is to keep improving the existing protocol to further improve efficiencies.\n\nAnd everyday innovators are taking up this task to do just that. Plus, computer chips also continue to advance by the day, improving the efficiency of computation in relation to power intake. However, the main downside of this approach is as long as there is money to be made, more miners will continue flocking the Bitcoin scene and in return, more power will be consumed just as before.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms have also experimented with alternative protocols which consume way less energy. Such algorithms could potentially eliminate the energy consuming process of mining while at the same time recording transactions. The fact that a number of brilliant minds in the industry have realized the problem and are actively working on such algorithms shows a bright future.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBitcoin is not the only crypto out in the world today. It is just the most popular one when compared to the rest. There are plenty of more crypto types that require far less energy and less complex equations to solve. In its current state, Bitcoin mining is slowly but surely proving harmful to the environment. If the trend continues, and if a solution is not found soon, the effects will start to be felt within as little as a decade. All stakeholders should strive to come up with solutions that will help mitigate the overall accelerating effects that Bitcoin mining is having on global warming.",

        "text": "An American investor and his girlfriend have gone into hiding after Thailand declared their floating ocean home in violation of its sovereign territory \u2014 a crime punishable by death or life in prison.\n\nBitcoin entrepreneurs Chad Elwartowski and Nadia Supranee Thepdet say they\u2019ve fled the floating concrete home where they\u2019d been living as part of a libertarian-inspired movement known as \u201cseasteading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe lived on a floating houseboat for a few weeks, and now Thailand wants us killed,\u201d Elwartowski wrote in a Facebook post on April 15. He deleted the post and a followup post on Thursday morning.\n\nThailand\u2019s government says the two seasteaders were living as a micro-nation inside its sovereign territory in violation of the country\u2019s criminal code. Thai officials are also concerned the seastead might obstruct international shipping lanes and put cargo ships at risk.\n\nThe Third Thai Naval Area Command has filed a police complaint against the couple, the Bangkok Post reports. The Navy says the ocean home is 12 nautical miles off the coast of Phuket and therefore still within Thai territory.\n\nElwartowski argues the home is more than 13 nautical miles offshore and therefore in international waters. He says he and Thepdet were only living in the ocean house to promote it, and they did not design, build or pay for it.\n\n\u201cWe did not decide where to put the seastead,\u201d Elwartowski wrote in his now-deleted Facebook post on April 15 after fleeing the home. \u201cWe are enthusiastic supporters of the project who were lucky enough to be the first ones to stay on it.\u201d\n\nHe says he\u2019s gone into hiding with Thepdet and that they now fear for their lives. They\u2019re also worried about losing all of their possessions if the Thai navy decides to destroy the tiny structure.\n\nThailand has not publicly threatened to execute the couple.\n\nWhat is seasteading?\n\nSeasteaders seek to live free of government interference on international waters, according to Ocean Builders, the company that built Elwartowski\u2019s home. The couple has been documenting their life on Ocean Builders\u2019 platform as part of a promotional series on YouTube since March.\n\n\u201cOcean Builders is selling this oceanfront property at a fraction of the cost of any other place you would get ocean property,\u201d Elwartkowski says in one of the company\u2019s promotional videos.\n\nOcean Builders says it designed and paid for the seastead and it\u2019s concerned for the safety of the building\u2019s first occupants.\n\n\u201cWe hope this issue can be resolved diplomatically with the Thai government and are ready to talk to anyone in charge at any time,\u201d the company said in a statement on April 15.\n\nThe house itself is a small octagonal structure sitting atop a hollow concrete pillar that floats in the ocean. Ocean Builders says the design is inspired by oil rigs.\n\nElwartowski was an early Bitcoin investor and one of several entrepreneurs who operate Ocean Builders. Thepdet is a Bitcoin advocate from Thailand who goes by the name Nadia Summergirl.\n\nThe seasteading movement has become popular among libertarian entrepreneurs, including billionaire Peter Thiel, who was an early investor in Facebook.\n\nThiel is co-founder of the Seasteading Institute, an organization that aims to build an independent floating city off the coast of French Polynesia. The city would govern itself and use its own cryptocurrency with the intention of avoiding as much government regulation and taxes as possible. It would also be built as a haven against rising global sea levels.\n\nOcean Builders appears to be working in concert with the Seasteading Institute. Seasteading Institute president Joe Quirk directed one of the Ocean Builders\u2019 videos, and Elwartowski referred an interview request to the company\u2019s press office. The Seasteading Institute did not respond to an interview request.\n\nWATCH: Thai navy tows floating home of U.S. fugitive to shore\n\nOcean Builders had planned to start collecting money for 20 new seasteads on April 15, according to its website. However, the company has postponed the collection process until it gets \u201ceverything straightened out\u201d with the Thai government.\n\nThe first 20 floating homes are expected to be sold at cost for a target price of US$150,000 to $200,000, Elwartowski wrote in a blog post on Ocean Builders\u2019 site in February.\n\nThe company says a beacon on the platform is still broadcasting from a position 13 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand.\n\n\u201cThis indicates to us that the structure is still there,\u201d Ocean Builders wrote in a statement.",

He deleted the post and a followup post on Thursday morning.\n\nThailand\u2019s government says the two seasteaders were living as a micro-nation inside its sovereign territory in violation of the country\u2019s criminal code. Thai officials are also concerned the seastead might obstruct international shipping lanes and put cargo ships at risk.\n\nThe Third Thai Naval Area Command has filed a police complaint against the couple, the Bangkok Post reports. The Navy says the ocean home is 12 nautical miles off the coast of Phuket and therefore still within Thai territory.\n\nElwartowski argues the home is more than 13 nautical miles offshore and therefore in international waters. He says he and Thepdet were only living in the ocean house to promote it, and they did not design, build or pay for it.\n\n\u201cWe did not decide where to put the seastead,\u201d Elwartowski wrote in his now-deleted Facebook post on April 15 after fleeing the home. \u201cWe are enthusiastic supporters of the project who were lucky enough to be the first ones to stay on it.\u201d\n\nHe says he\u2019s gone into hiding with Thepdet and that they now fear for their lives. They\u2019re also worried about losing all of their possessions if the Thai navy decides to destroy the tiny structure.\n\nThailand has not publicly threatened to execute the couple.\n\nWhat is seasteading?\n\nSeasteaders seek to live free of government interference on international waters, according to Ocean Builders, the company that built Elwartowski\u2019s home. The couple has been documenting their life on Ocean Builders\u2019 platform as part of a promotional series on YouTube since March.\n\n\u201cOcean Builders is selling this oceanfront property at a fraction of the cost of any other place you would get ocean property,\u201d Elwartkowski says in one of the company\u2019s promotional videos.\n\nOcean Builders says it designed and paid for the seastead and it\u2019s concerned for the safety of the building\u2019s first occupants.\n\n\u201cWe hope this issue can be resolved diplomatically with the Thai government and are ready to talk to anyone in charge at any time,\u201d the company said in a statement on April 15.\n\nThe house itself is a small octagonal structure sitting atop a hollow concrete pillar that floats in the ocean. Ocean Builders says the design is inspired by oil rigs.\n\nElwartowski was an early Bitcoin investor and one of several entrepreneurs who operate Ocean Builders. Thepdet is a Bitcoin advocate from Thailand who goes by the name Nadia Summergirl.\n\nThe seasteading movement has become popular among libertarian entrepreneurs, including billionaire Peter Thiel, who was an early investor in Facebook.\n\nThiel is co-founder of the Seasteading Institute, an organization that aims to build an independent floating city off the coast of French Polynesia. The city would govern itself and use its own cryptocurrency with the intention of avoiding as much government regulation and taxes as possible. It would also be built as a haven against rising global sea levels.\n\nOcean Builders appears to be working in concert with the Seasteading Institute. Seasteading Institute president Joe Quirk directed one of the Ocean Builders\u2019 videos, and Elwartowski referred an interview request to the company\u2019s press office. The Seasteading Institute did not respond to an interview request.\n\nWATCH: Thai navy tows floating home of U.S. fugitive to shore\n\nOcean Builders had planned to start collecting money for 20 new seasteads on April 15, according to its website. However, the company has postponed the collection process until it gets \u201ceverything straightened out\u201d with the Thai government.\n\nThe first 20 floating homes are expected to be sold at cost for a target price of US$150,000 to $200,000, Elwartowski wrote in a blog post on Ocean Builders\u2019 site in February.\n\nThe company says a beacon on the platform is still broadcasting from a position 13 nautical miles off the coast of Thailand.\n\n\u201cThis indicates to us that the structure is still there,\u201d Ocean Builders wrote in a statement.",
