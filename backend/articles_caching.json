        "text": "Trump's North Korea diplomacy looks troubled. It may not mean war\n\nPresident Donald Trump's attempt to make a \"great deal\" with North Korea over its nuclear program appears increasingly in peril as Kim Jong Un has ordered new missile tests and directed his country's military \"to cope with any emergency.\"\n\n\"Nobody's happy,\" Trump said Thursday after North Korea launched short-range missiles for the second time in less than a week. On Friday, Kim told his forces to be on high alert after the U.S. seized a large cargo ship that was attempting to smuggle coal out of North Korea in violation of United Nations Security Council sanctions.\n\n\"(Kim) stressed the need to further increase the capability of the defense units in the forefront area and on the western front to carry out combat tasks and keep full combat posture,\" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), a state media outlet that rarely quotes Pyongyang's leader directly, reported. KCNA said Kim \"set forth important tasks for further increasing the strike ability\" of North Korea's weapon systems.\n\nDiplomacy?: North Korea launches second projectile in less than a week\n\nAnalysts said the implications for Trump's diplomatic efforts at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula were not entirely clear, and that while North Korea's escalating rhetoric and military preparedness did not signal war, it showed how far apart the two nations were after two historic summits between Trump and North Korea's leader.\n\n\"These new developments show that neither country is able to sustain any kind of negotiation beyond the summits,\" said Waheguru Pal Singh, a defense and foreign policy expert at New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation, who has also consulted for the United Nations on international peace and security issues.\n\n\"For me, the key marker will be if the U.S. resumes joint military exercises with South Korea, and how the North reacts,\" he said, referring to longstanding annual large-scale Washington-Seoul military drills Trump ended in March to reduce tensions.\n\nAbout 28,000 U.S. troops plus thousands more family members and Department of Defense employees are stationed in South Korea, and their presence, and the joint military exercises, have for years been a source of North Korean anger.\n\nThe projectiles North Korea launched Saturday, and then Thursday, were the first since Pyongyang paused missile launches in late 2017. All splash-landed in the Pacific.\n\nTrump has refused to yield to North Korean demands to lift economic sanctions.\n\nSanctions no-no:U.S. seizes North Korea cargo ship linked to exporting tons of coal\n\nSouth Korea and U.S. intelligence analysts are still examining the missiles, but Michael Elleman, a missile defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank with offices in London and Washington, said they resemble the Russian-designed Iskander, which has a range of about 200 miles and can fit a warhead.\n\n\"Iskander can exploit gaps in South Korean and American missile-defense coverage,\" Elleman wrote in a blog post on 38 North, a Koreas-focused website.\n\nThere was further evidence that North Korea may be ramping up its military capabilities even as the Trump administration has insisted the president has maintained a good relationship with Kim despite summits in Singapore and Vietnam that ended with no tangible denuclearization steps for Pyongyang.\n\nOn Thursday night, Beyond Parallel, a program affiliated with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a global affairs think tank, published new satellite images that appeared to show that North Korea has been secretly operating a missile base that it has never previously disclosed.\n\nIn its analysis of the images, Beyond Parallel said that, though unconfirmed, the \"Yusang-ni\" base may house intercontinental ballistic missiles with a \"first strike\" capability against targets located throughout East Asia, the Pacific and the U.S.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has previously said that any missile tests by North Korea involving long-range or intercontinental missiles would be a diplomatic red line.\n\n\"It is evident that Trump's diplomatic strategy has reached an impasse,\" said Richard Caplan, a professor of international relations at Oxford University, England. \"And trade frictions with China mean that he can't count on Beijing to rein Kim in,\" he added, referring to fraught trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.\n\nNorth Korea relies on China for aid, fuel and other imports. Beijing has acted as a buffer between Pyongyang, a close ally, and Washington. Beijing's escalating trade war with Washington may make it feel less inclined to act as a referee.\n\nTrade war: U.S., China break off latest trade talks without announcing deal\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is embroiled in another front: Iran.\n\nThe White House has increasingly appeared to risk military confrontation with Tehran following U.S. and Israeli intelligence warnings that Iran or its proxies could be planning attacks on U.S. troops and facilities in the Middle East.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said it was adding a missile defense system and warship to the aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers it has already sent to the Persian Gulf to meet any Iranian threats. \"It's important that Iran understand that an attack on Americans or our interests would be met with an appropriate response,\" said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. He said the threats were credible.\n\nYet the vast majority of Iran-watchers and experts have accused the Trump administration, in particular Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, of potentially inflating the intelligence because of an almost obsessive dislike for Iran.\n\n\"Trump is treating North Korea as if it has no nuclear weapons, and Iran as if it does,\" said Singh, the defense expert at New York University, referring to what he said was the president's apparent willingness to take Kim at his word that he wants to denuclearize while ignoring repeated verifications from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that Tehran has been complying with the 2015 nuclear accord Trump withdrew the U.S. from. \"It's a very unorthodox approach,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Download the USA TODAY app",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump will head into his second meeting with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un having reframed what would make a successful summit, lowering expectations for Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization while eager to declare a flashy victory to offset the political turmoil he faces at home.\n\nTrump was the driving force behind this week\u2019s Vietnam summit, aiming to recreate the global spectacle of his first meeting with Kim, although that initial summit yielded few concrete results and the months that followed have produced little optimism about what will be achieved in the sequel. He once warned that North Korea\u2019s arsenal posed such a threat to humanity that he may have no choice but to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the rogue nation, yet on Sunday declared that he was in no hurry for Pyongyang to prove it was abandoning its weapons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a rush. I don\u2019t want to rush anybody, I just don\u2019t want testing. As long as there\u2019s no testing, we\u2019re happy,\u201d Trump told a gathering of governors at the White House. Hours earlier, he ended a tweet about the summit by posing the key question that looms over their meeting in Vietnam: \u201cDenuclearization?\u201d\n\nHe did not provide an answer.\n\nThough worries abound across world capitals about what Trump might be willing to give up in the name of a win, the president was ready to write himself into the history books before he and Kim even shake hands in Hanoi.\n\n\u201cIf I were not elected president, you would have been in a war with North Korea,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cWe now have a situation where the relationships are good \u2014 where there has been no nuclear testing, no missiles, no rockets.\u201d\n\nWhatever the North Koreans have done so far, the survival of the Kim regime is always the primary concern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim inherited a nascent, incomplete nuclear program from his father, and after years of accelerated effort and fighting through crippling sanctions, he built an arsenal that demonstrates the potential capability to deliver a thermonuclear weapon to the mainland United States. That is the fundamental reason Washington now sits at the negotiating table.\n\nKim, his world standing elevated after receiving an audience with a U.S. president, has yet to show a convincing sign that he is willing to deal away an arsenal that might provide a stronger guarantee of survival than whatever security assurance the United States could provide. The North Koreans have largely eschewed staff-level talks, pushing for discussions between Trump and Kim.\n\nTrump will arrive in Hanoi on Tuesday on Air Force One while his counterpart, lacking a modern aircraft fleet, travels via armored train. Though details of the summit remain closely held, the two leaders are expected to meet at some point one-on-one, joined only by translators.\n\nThe easing of tension between the two nations, Trump and his allies believe, stems from the U.S. president\u2019s own unorthodox and unpredictable style of diplomacy. Often prizing personal rapport over long-held strategic interests, Trump has pointed to his budding relationship with the young and reclusive leader, frequently showing visitors to the Oval Office his flattering letters from Kim.\n\nTrump, who has long declared that North Korea represented the gravest foreign threat of his presidency, told reporters recently that his efforts to defang Pyongyang had moved Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize, something Abe would not confirm or deny. And, always with an eye on his media coverage, Trump had delighted in the round-the-clock phenomenon created by the first Kim summit, held last June in Singapore. He urged reluctant aides as early as last fall to begin preparations for a second meeting.\n\nThe images of the first face-to-face meeting between a U.S. president and his North Korean counterpart resonated across the globe. Four main goals emerged: establishing new relations between the nations, building a new peace on the Korean Peninsula, completing denuclearization of the peninsula and recovering U.S. POW/MIA remains from the Korean War.\n\nWhile some remains have been returned to the United States, little has been achieved on the other points. Korean and American negotiators have not settled on either the parameters of denuclearization or the timetable for the removal of both Korean weapons and American sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe key lessons of Singapore are that President Trump sees tremendous value in the imagery of diplomacy and wants to be seen as a bold leader, even if the substance of the diplomacy is far behind the pageantry,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials testified before Congress last month that it remains unlikely Kim would fully dismantle his arsenal. And many voices in the Trump administration, including national security adviser John Bolton, have expressed skepticism that North Korea would ever live up to a deal.\n\nMark Chinoy, senior fellow at U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, made clear that after generations of hostility, the convivial atmosphere of Singapore \u201ccan\u2019t be discounted.\u201d But Chinoy noted that Trump had agreed to North Korean\u2019s \u201cformulation of \u2018denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\u2019 which Pyongyang has long made clear meant an end to the US security alliance with South Korea and an end to the US nuclear umbrella intended to defend South Korea and Japan.\u201d\n\nAfter the last summit, Trump unilaterally suspended some military drills with South Korea, alarming some in Seoul and at the Pentagon. But he was insistent this week that he would not drawdown U.S. troops from South Korea. And American officials, even as they hint at a relaxed timetable for Pyongyang to account for its full arsenal, have continued to publicly insist they would not ease punishing sanctions on North Korea until denuclearization is complete.\n\nA year ago, North Korea suspended its nuclear and long-range missile tests and said it dismantled its nuclear testing ground but those measures were not perceived as meaningful reductions. Experts believe Kim, who is enjoying warmer relations with South Korea and the easing of pressure from Russia and China, will seek a U.S. commitment for improved bilateral relations and partial sanctions relief while trying to minimize any concessions on his nuclear facilities and weapons.\n\n\u201cKim is doing pretty well as it is,\u201d said Scott Seaman of the Eurasia Group. \u201cThe threat of a U.S. military strike is essentially zero, Kim\u2019s diplomatic charm offensive has made him into a bigger player on the world stage, and he continues to whittle away at international commitment to sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe Hanoi summit comes at a politically perilous time for Trump.\n\nHis potential 2020 foes have begun unleashing their attacks. The newly elected Democratic House has begun its onslaught of investigations into the president, calling his former fixer, Michael Cohen, to appear before Congress while the president is in Vietnam. And special counsel Robert Mueller, who has investigated possible ties between Trump\u2019s campaign Russian election interference, may finalize his report within days of the president\u2019s return to the United States.\n\nTrump may be eager to change the subject and some foreign policy experts fear that could prompt the president to make a significant concession or strike an attention-grabbing deal \u2014 such as a declaration to formally end the Korean War, which has been suspended in an armistice since 1953 \u2014 without extracting much in return from Kim. North Korea\u2019s long history of human rights abuses is also unlikely to be on the agenda.\n\n\u201cClearly, the president is looking for a win,\u201d said Denmark. \u201cThe North Koreans know this and will likely expect President Trump to be looking to make an agreement with limited regard for its content.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul and Deb Riechmann, Catherine Lucey, Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Redefining success, President Donald Trump heads into his second meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un determined to tamp down expectations that he'll gain a roadmap to denuclearization. Yet he's still eager to claim an attention-grabbing victory to offset the political turmoil he faces at home.\n\nTrump laid out ultimate goals for both the U.S. and Kim in an appearance before the nation's governors Monday before boarding Air Force One to fly to Vietnam: \"We want denuclearization, and I think he'll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy.\"\n\nWorries abound across world capitals about what Trump might be willing to give up in the name of a win, but there seems less mystery about his North Korean counterpart.

        "text": "opinion\n\nTrump has entered Phase 2 of his legal defense strategy: All-out war with Congress\n\nWe are seeing Phase 2 of Donald Trump\u2019s legal strategy to defend himself against government investigations. It\u2019s called, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas,\u201d and it amounts to an all-out war with Congress.\n\nIn Phase 1, Trump knew special counsel Robert Mueller could never lay a glove on him because of the Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The Phase 1 legal strategy seemed to be produce documents and witnesses so Attorney General William Barr could announce that the White House had \"fully cooperated\" \u2014 even though the president himself refused to be interviewed, no criminal charges could be filed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could proclaim \u201ccase closed.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump faces investigation from a coequal branch of government that actually could remove him from office through impeachment, the Phase 2 strategy kicks in: Fight everything.\n\nThe Mueller investigation turned out to be a fool\u2019s errand from the start. As Barr has stated repeatedly, prosecutors make \u201cbinary\u201d decisions: Charge or don\u2019t charge. Except here\u2019s the trick: When investigating a president, given DOJ policy, the only possible decision is don\u2019t charge. In other words, heads I win, tails you lose. Cooperation is easy when you can\u2019t be charged.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMueller didn't say it so we did: Trump would face felony charges if he weren't president\n\nMnuchin defies the law by withholding Trump tax returns. Congress can't let this stand.\n\nTrump administration could leave Congress no choice but an impeachment inquiry: Lieu\n\nIn Phase 2, Trump is making no pretense of cooperating. Instead, he's characterizing congressional investigations as an effort to relitigate the Mueller investigation. The fallacy of his argument is that while Mueller believed he could not charge Trump, he deferred to Congress as the appropriate body to check the president. Facts developed by Mueller may be helpful to Congress, but these investigations are different because they could result in serious consequences for the president.\n\nAn escalating accumulation of obstruction\n\nRather than cooperating, Trump has filed lawsuits to block his accounting firm and banks from complying with subpoenas to produce his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Mueller should not testify before Congress, even though Barr has said that he has no objection. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a request from House Ways and Means Committee to produce Trump\u2019s tax returns, despite a law stating that he \u201cshall furnish\u201d returns upon request.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House prohibited former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena for documents, stating that the president might want to assert executive privilege. On Wednesday, the White House asserted executive privilege over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, including statements made to investigators during interviews, for which the privilege has arguably been waived. That same day, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration is engaged in \u201ca cumulative effect of obstruction\u201d that could lead to other contempt of Congress citations.\n\nExecutive privilege is a recognized doctrine that presidents may use to protect confidential communications, national security matters and agency deliberations. DOJ has also historically asserted executive privilege to protect ongoing investigations and individuals\u2019 privacy interests. But the parameters of executive privilege are largely undefined, and the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that the privilege is a qualified one that must yield when items are subpoenaed for criminal trial. We entrust our executive branch officials to exercise the privilege judiciously to protect legitimate interests, such as fostering candid advice from aides, and not to use it as a shield to conceal misconduct.\n\n'Accommodation' is not how Trump rolls\n\nIn the past, we have counted on norms to help us avoid showdowns between branches of government, sometimes described as a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d One of these norms is the process of accommodation, in which branches of government negotiate a resolution that allows the parties to move on without court intervention. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general, William French Smith, described accommodation in a 1981 opinion as essential to responsible exercise of government power: \u201cThe accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge, and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.\u201d\n\nEven so, we all know by now that \u201caccommodation\u201d is not how Trump rolls. He is a disrupter. He is not afraid to break the norms; in fact, he thrives on it. Norm-busting is part of his appeal to his base. He does not shrink from a good fight. He has made a career of using the legal process to bully others to get his way.\n\nAnd even if Trump ultimately loses his legal battles in Phase 2, success is not necessarily defined as prevailing in court, but in delaying any resolution until after the 2020 election. Some even suggest Trump is daring congressional Democrats to impeach him, knowing that the Republican-led Senate will never convict him, and luring his opponents into a political trap that will help him win reelection.\n\nCongress must protect Constitution, not Trump\n\nThis is no way to run a government. While Trump\u2019s strategy to stonewall might help him \u201cwin,\u201d it could do long-term damage to our country.

It\u2019s called, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas,\u201d and it amounts to an all-out war with Congress.\n\nIn Phase 1, Trump knew special counsel Robert Mueller could never lay a glove on him because of the Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The Phase 1 legal strategy seemed to be produce documents and witnesses so Attorney General William Barr could announce that the White House had \"fully cooperated\" \u2014 even though the president himself refused to be interviewed, no criminal charges could be filed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could proclaim \u201ccase closed.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump faces investigation from a coequal branch of government that actually could remove him from office through impeachment, the Phase 2 strategy kicks in: Fight everything.\n\nThe Mueller investigation turned out to be a fool\u2019s errand from the start. As Barr has stated repeatedly, prosecutors make \u201cbinary\u201d decisions: Charge or don\u2019t charge. Except here\u2019s the trick: When investigating a president, given DOJ policy, the only possible decision is don\u2019t charge. In other words, heads I win, tails you lose. Cooperation is easy when you can\u2019t be charged.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMueller didn't say it so we did: Trump would face felony charges if he weren't president\n\nMnuchin defies the law by withholding Trump tax returns. Congress can't let this stand.\n\nTrump administration could leave Congress no choice but an impeachment inquiry: Lieu\n\nIn Phase 2, Trump is making no pretense of cooperating. Instead, he's characterizing congressional investigations as an effort to relitigate the Mueller investigation. The fallacy of his argument is that while Mueller believed he could not charge Trump, he deferred to Congress as the appropriate body to check the president. Facts developed by Mueller may be helpful to Congress, but these investigations are different because they could result in serious consequences for the president.\n\nAn escalating accumulation of obstruction\n\nRather than cooperating, Trump has filed lawsuits to block his accounting firm and banks from complying with subpoenas to produce his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Mueller should not testify before Congress, even though Barr has said that he has no objection. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a request from House Ways and Means Committee to produce Trump\u2019s tax returns, despite a law stating that he \u201cshall furnish\u201d returns upon request.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House prohibited former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena for documents, stating that the president might want to assert executive privilege. On Wednesday, the White House asserted executive privilege over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, including statements made to investigators during interviews, for which the privilege has arguably been waived. That same day, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration is engaged in \u201ca cumulative effect of obstruction\u201d that could lead to other contempt of Congress citations.\n\nExecutive privilege is a recognized doctrine that presidents may use to protect confidential communications, national security matters and agency deliberations. DOJ has also historically asserted executive privilege to protect ongoing investigations and individuals\u2019 privacy interests. But the parameters of executive privilege are largely undefined, and the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that the privilege is a qualified one that must yield when items are subpoenaed for criminal trial. We entrust our executive branch officials to exercise the privilege judiciously to protect legitimate interests, such as fostering candid advice from aides, and not to use it as a shield to conceal misconduct.\n\n'Accommodation' is not how Trump rolls\n\nIn the past, we have counted on norms to help us avoid showdowns between branches of government, sometimes described as a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d One of these norms is the process of accommodation, in which branches of government negotiate a resolution that allows the parties to move on without court intervention. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general, William French Smith, described accommodation in a 1981 opinion as essential to responsible exercise of government power: \u201cThe accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge, and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.\u201d\n\nEven so, we all know by now that \u201caccommodation\u201d is not how Trump rolls. He is a disrupter. He is not afraid to break the norms; in fact, he thrives on it. Norm-busting is part of his appeal to his base. He does not shrink from a good fight. He has made a career of using the legal process to bully others to get his way.\n\nAnd even if Trump ultimately loses his legal battles in Phase 2, success is not necessarily defined as prevailing in court, but in delaying any resolution until after the 2020 election. Some even suggest Trump is daring congressional Democrats to impeach him, knowing that the Republican-led Senate will never convict him, and luring his opponents into a political trap that will help him win reelection.\n\nCongress must protect Constitution, not Trump\n\nThis is no way to run a government. While Trump\u2019s strategy to stonewall might help him \u201cwin,\u201d it could do long-term damage to our country. Our constitutional system is built on checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. But the system relies on people of good faith to exercise those checks and balances.\n\nFor example, the president must not just execute the law but also take care that the laws be executed \u201cfaithfully.\u201d And members of Congress owe their allegiance not just to their party but also to their country, as Republican lawmakers demonstrated during the Watergate scandal. Their oath of office swears them to support and defend the Constitution, not the president or their party.\n\nAs Trump tests the norms of government, we need members of the executive and legislative branches to overcome tribal instincts and do what\u2019s best for our nation. For members of the executive branch, that means using executive privilege on an item-by-item basis and not for blanket protection from all inquiry.

        "publishDate": "2019-05-04 21:52:14+00:00",
        "text": "By Iqbal Jassat\n\nIf America\u2019s standing in the globe as the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d has been on shaky grounds following its disastrous wars post-9/11, US president Donald Trump has ensured that whatever little credibility it may still have enjoyed among European allies and the United Nations, is totally ruined.\n\nHis messy and bloody military adventure in Libya via the CIA-trained General Haftar, is reflective of the growing alienation with international conventions his administration is being viewed with.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to finance and equip Haftar with sophisticated weapons including fighter jets, has met with fierce resistance from the UN-recognized government. That the military attempt via a bloody coup to install Haftar has failed thus far, the ongoing bloodletting is further indication that Trump will defiantly pursue his regime-change agenda regardless of innocent lives being lost.\n\nPolicies of lose-lose have characterized Trump since his inception and if the electoral strength of his rightwing white supremacists persists, his second term may turn out to be worse. America\u2019s leadership will remain firmly stuck in the hands of neocons and Israel\u2019s equally racist colonialists.\n\nTrumpism has outstripped Machiavellism. And unlike the false sophistry of previous administrations particularly that of Clinton and Obama, Trump\u2019s buffoonery is blatantly associated with visible layers of arrogance, deceit, corruption and disdain.\n\nHis illegal intervention in Venezuela is further evidence of rampant power gone astray. It is to be expected of hoodlums, which is what Trump\u2019s gung-ho meddling in the affairs of other nations defines him as.\n\nVenezuela has been engulfed with a civil war as Trump\u2019s men put the squeeze on the military to abandon President Maduro.\n\nRightwing hawks including John Bolton have demanded that senior military officials pull the rug to allow US-backed Guaido to assume power and control of the oil-rich country. A coup is underway whether the world likes it or not, is the blunt message emanating from the White House.\n\nApart from creating civil strife in Libya and Venezuela, Trump\u2019s mafia-type operation can also be gauged by his apparent blackmailing of Ecuador.\n\nThe case of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and how Ecuador traded him for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), illustrates the danger to whistleblowers resulting from Washington\u2019s control of the IMF.\n\nYou can\u2019t get an IMF loan unless the United States (read Donald Trump) approves it \u2013 upon agreement to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy.\n\nUS military involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen, under the direct command of Trump, is another case in point. Though Congress voted in favor of a resolution to end US support, Trump vetoed it. His calculation is obviously based on the trade-offs he can and has secured with Saudi crown prince Mohamed bin Salman (MbS).\n\nNow that a new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the US-backed Saudi war of aggression on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previous assessments, its left to be seen whether Congress will vote to overturn Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nWhile it appears that American-based commentators, who by the way are a tickey-a-dozen on CNN, FOX and most media outlets, are pitted against each other in attempts to either rationalize or ridicule Trump\u2019s actions, the Donald show moves on in a blaze of fiery rhetoric and unilateral action.\n\nRecently Trump made one of his trademark boisterous remarks about Saudi Arabia, claiming he warned King Salman he would not last in power for \u201ctwo weeks\u201d without the backing of the US military.\n\nWhile it may be undiplomatic, the House of Saud knows only too well that it is true.\n\nNot only is it a confirmation of the devastating reach American imperialism has, but it also says to the world that Trump and his group of thugs do not care about respecting civilized values.\n\nIn the case of Iran, Trump has boasted that not only does he trust Netanyahu\u2019s allegations despite his own intelligence agencies disputing Israel\u2019s so-called \u201cevidence\u201d, but he is also willing to sacrifice American soldiers on behalf of Zionist ideals.\n\nSanctions against Iran coupled with threats of a full-scale war, in abject compliance with Israel\u2019s dictates, have the potential to plunge the world to levels of unprecedented chaos and instability. Consequences of it hold the promise of a horror movie, except that it will be a reality.\n\nTrump\u2019s unilateral decision to break out of Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement has not been favorably met by Europe. But Trump\u2019s recklessness knows no bounds. That he has done so to satisfy Netanyahu, with the full knowledge of turning his administration into a pariah in the eyes of European signatories is not a secret.\n\nTrump\u2019s disdain for international conventions and humanitarian laws is unfortunately not only confined to the countries and regions mentioned above. His outrageous assault on Palestinian rights confirms how repugnant and depraved Trump\u2019s administration is.\n\nTo bring Palestinians into line, and to force a Saudi-backed Bantustan leadership to accept whatever bizarre version of \u2018peace\u2019 Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner has plotted in league with Netanyahu, Trump has taken several steps aimed at intimidating the PA.\n\nThese include the cutting of $200 million in direct aid to Gaza and the West Bank and the freezing of another $300 million dollars provided annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).\n\nTo illustrate how determined Trump is to reign as America\u2019s undisputed rogue leader, look no further than his arbitrary decree to \u201cgrant\u201d Jerusalem, the Golan and now the Occupied West Bank to the region\u2019s colonial settler regime Israel. A foreign intervention which not only defies UNSC resolutions but also \u201cgifts\u201d Netanyahu what he and fellow Zionists plotted to expand Israel\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise.\n\nTrump\u2019s single-minded goal to reshape the world in his image will ultimately become his albatross. But until then, fueling wars and conflicts in pursuance of undisguised white supremacist hegemony will continue to take a toll on human lives.\n\n\u2013 Iqbal Jassat is an Executive Member of the South Africa-based Media Review Network.

            "text": "By Iqbal Jassat\n\nIf America\u2019s standing in the globe as the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d has been on shaky grounds following its disastrous wars post-9/11, US president Donald Trump has ensured that whatever little credibility it may still have enjoyed among European allies and the United Nations, is totally ruined.\n\nHis messy and bloody military adventure in Libya via the CIA-trained General Haftar, is reflective of the growing alienation with international conventions his administration is being viewed with.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to finance and equip Haftar with sophisticated weapons including fighter jets, has met with fierce resistance from the UN-recognized government. That the military attempt via a bloody coup to install Haftar has failed thus far, the ongoing bloodletting is further indication that Trump will defiantly pursue his regime-change agenda regardless of innocent lives being lost.\n\nPolicies of lose-lose have characterized Trump since his inception and if the electoral strength of his rightwing white supremacists persists, his second term may turn out to be worse. America\u2019s leadership will remain firmly stuck in the hands of neocons and Israel\u2019s equally racist colonialists.\n\nTrumpism has outstripped Machiavellism. And unlike the false sophistry of previous administrations particularly that of Clinton and Obama, Trump\u2019s buffoonery is blatantly associated with visible layers of arrogance, deceit, corruption and disdain.\n\nHis illegal intervention in Venezuela is further evidence of rampant power gone astray. It is to be expected of hoodlums, which is what Trump\u2019s gung-ho meddling in the affairs of other nations defines him as.\n\nVenezuela has been engulfed with a civil war as Trump\u2019s men put the squeeze on the military to abandon President Maduro.\n\nRightwing hawks including John Bolton have demanded that senior military officials pull the rug to allow US-backed Guaido to assume power and control of the oil-rich country. A coup is underway whether the world likes it or not, is the blunt message emanating from the White House.\n\nApart from creating civil strife in Libya and Venezuela, Trump\u2019s mafia-type operation can also be gauged by his apparent blackmailing of Ecuador.\n\nThe case of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and how Ecuador traded him for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), illustrates the danger to whistleblowers resulting from Washington\u2019s control of the IMF.\n\nYou can\u2019t get an IMF loan unless the United States (read Donald Trump) approves it \u2013 upon agreement to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy.\n\nUS military involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen, under the direct command of Trump, is another case in point. Though Congress voted in favor of a resolution to end US support, Trump vetoed it. His calculation is obviously based on the trade-offs he can and has secured with Saudi crown prince Mohamed bin Salman (MbS).\n\nNow that a new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the US-backed Saudi war of aggression on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previous assessments, its left to be seen whether Congress will vote to overturn Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nWhile it appears that American-based commentators, who by the way are a tickey-a-dozen on CNN, FOX and most media outlets, are pitted against each other in attempts to either rationalize or ridicule Trump\u2019s actions, the Donald show moves on in a blaze of fiery rhetoric and unilateral action.\n\nRecently Trump made one of his trademark boisterous remarks about Saudi Arabia, claiming he warned King Salman he would not last in power for \u201ctwo weeks\u201d without the backing of the US military.\n\nWhile it may be undiplomatic, the House of Saud knows only too well that it is true.\n\nNot only is it a confirmation of the devastating reach American imperialism has, but it also says to the world that Trump and his group of thugs do not care about respecting civilized values.\n\nIn the case of Iran, Trump has boasted that not only does he trust Netanyahu\u2019s allegations despite his own intelligence agencies disputing Israel\u2019s so-called \u201cevidence\u201d, but he is also willing to sacrifice American soldiers on behalf of Zionist ideals.\n\nSanctions against Iran coupled with threats of a full-scale war, in abject compliance with Israel\u2019s dictates, have the potential to plunge the world to levels of unprecedented chaos and instability. Consequences of it hold the promise of a horror movie, except that it will be a reality.\n\nTrump\u2019s unilateral decision to break out of Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement has not been favorably met by Europe. But Trump\u2019s recklessness knows no bounds. That he has done so to satisfy Netanyahu, with the full knowledge of turning his administration into a pariah in the eyes of European signatories is not a secret.\n\nTrump\u2019s disdain for international conventions and humanitarian laws is unfortunately not only confined to the countries and regions mentioned above. His outrageous assault on Palestinian rights confirms how repugnant and depraved Trump\u2019s administration is.\n\nTo bring Palestinians into line, and to force a Saudi-backed Bantustan leadership to accept whatever bizarre version of \u2018peace\u2019 Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner has plotted in league with Netanyahu, Trump has taken several steps aimed at intimidating the PA.\n\nThese include the cutting of $200 million in direct aid to Gaza and the West Bank and the freezing of another $300 million dollars provided annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).\n\nTo illustrate how determined Trump is to reign as America\u2019s undisputed rogue leader, look no further than his arbitrary decree to \u201cgrant\u201d Jerusalem, the Golan and now the Occupied West Bank to the region\u2019s colonial settler regime Israel. A foreign intervention which not only defies UNSC resolutions but also \u201cgifts\u201d Netanyahu what he and fellow Zionists plotted to expand Israel\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise.\n\nTrump\u2019s single-minded goal to reshape the world in his image will ultimately become his albatross. But until then, fueling wars and conflicts in pursuance of undisguised white supremacist hegemony will continue to take a toll on human lives.\n\n\u2013 Iqbal Jassat is an Executive Member of the South Africa-based Media Review Network.
