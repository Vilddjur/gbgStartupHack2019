        "text": "US reportedly opposed deal, which follows concerns that villages in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia had \u2018turned into dumpsites\u2019\n\nAlmost all the world\u2019s countries have agreed on a deal aimed at restricting shipments of hard-to-recycle plastic waste to poorer countries, the United Nations announced on Friday.\n\nExporting countries \u2013 including the US \u2013 now will have to obtain consent from countries receiving contaminated, mixed or unrecyclable plastic waste. Currently, the US and other countries can send lower-quality plastic waste to private entities in developing countries without getting approval from their governments.\n\nSince China stopped accepting recycling from the US, activists say they have observed plastic waste piling up in developing countries. The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (Gaia), a backer of the deal, says it found villages in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia that had \u201cturned into dumpsites over the course of a year\u201d.\n\nRunaway consumption: 2tn drinks containers being used every year Read more\n\n\u201cWe were finding that there was waste from the US that was just piled up in villages throughout these countries that had once been primarily agricultural communities,\u201d said Claire Arkin, a spokeswoman for Gaia.\n\n\n\nThe legally binding framework emerged at the end of a two-week meeting of UN-backed conventions on plastic waste and toxic, hazardous chemicals that threaten the planet\u2019s seas and creatures. The pact comes in an amendment to the Basel convention. The US is not a party to that convention so it did not have a vote, but attendees at the meeting said the country argued against the change, saying officials didn\u2019t understand the repercussions it would have on the plastic waste trade.\n\nPlastic debris clutters pristine land, floats in huge masses in oceans and entangles and endangers wildlife. Less valuable and harder to recycle plastic is likely to end up discarded rather than turned into new products. The deal affects products used in a broad array of industries, such as healthcare, technology, aerospace, fashion and food and beverages.\n\nRolph Payet of the United Nations Environment Program called the agreement \u2013 signed by 187 countries in Geneva, Switzerland, under the convention \u2013 \u201chistoric\u201d, because countries will have to monitor where plastic waste goes when it leaves their borders. Payet said the negotiations, which began 11 days ago and brought together 1,400 delegates, had gone much further than anticipated.\n\nHe compared plastic pollution to an \u201cepidemic\u201d, with \u201can estimated 100m tonnes of plastic [110m US tons] now found in the oceans, 80 to 90% of which comes from land-based sources\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man carries plastic bottles for recycling in Nairobi, Kenya. Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP\n\nThe Basel convention sets rules for first-world countries shipping hazardous waste to less wealthy nations. Backers say the amendment will make the global trade in plastic waste more transparent and better regulated, protecting humans and the environment.\n\nThe US and other countries now will not be able to send the plastic waste to developing countries that are part of the Basel convention and are not part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a press release from major advocacy organizations explained.\n\nOfficials attributed the progress partly to growing public awareness \u2013 reinforced by documentary films by the British naturalist Sir David Attenborough and others \u2013 of the dangers of plastic pollution, especially to marine life.\n\n\u201cIt was those iconic images of the dead albatross chicks on the Pacific Islands with their stomachs open and all recognizable plastic items inside it, and most recently, it\u2019s been when we discovered the nano-particles do cross the blood-brain barrier, and we were able to prove that plastic is in us,\u201d said Paul Rose, expedition leader for the National Geographic \u201cpristine seas\u201d expeditions, aimed at protecting the oceans.\n\nRecent images that went viral of dead whales washing up with hundreds of pounds of plastic garbage in their stomachs also widely shocked the public. A new online petition entitled \u201cStop dumping plastic in paradise!\u201d has attracted almost a million signatures in the past week.\n\nThe new rules will take a year to come into force.\n\nVon Hernandez, global coordinator for Break Free from Plastic, said the deal is \u201ca crucial first step towards stopping the use of developing countries as a dumping ground for the world\u2019s plastic waste, especially those coming from rich nations\u201d.\n\nMarco Lambertini, director general of the environmental and wildlife charity WWF International, said the accord is a welcome step and that for too long wealthy countries have abdicated responsibility for enormous quantities of plastic waste.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only goes part of the way. What we \u2013 and the planet \u2013 need is a comprehensive treaty to tackle the global plastic crisis,\u201d Lambertini added.\n\n",

        "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The USS Arlington will join the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf\n\nThe US is sending a Patriot missile-defence system to the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.\n\nA warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf.\n\nAnd US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense.\n\nTehran has described the deployments as \"psychological warfare\" aimed at intimidating the country.\n\nIran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities.\n\nWhy is the US sending additional forces?\n\nThe Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats.\n\nThe latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was \"ready to defend US forces and interests in the region\", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran.\n\nThere are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The US Patriot missile defence system (stock photo)\n\nThe Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft.\n\nOfficials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said.\n\nIran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be \"destroyed with one missile\".\n\nWhat's the state of US-Iran relations?\n\nLast year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015.\n\nUnder the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief.\n\nLast month, the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group.\n\nThe White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil.\n\nThe sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East.\n\nIran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass.\n\nEarlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed.\n\nIt also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days.\n\nEuropean powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they \"reject any ultimatums\" from Tehran to prevent its collapse.\n\nPressure or more?\n\nThe real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun.\n\nIn the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain.\n\nBut Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran.\n\nThe pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments.\n\nA difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.",

            "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The USS Arlington will join the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf\n\nThe US is sending a Patriot missile-defence system to the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.\n\nA warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf.\n\nAnd US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense.\n\nTehran has described the deployments as \"psychological warfare\" aimed at intimidating the country.\n\nIran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities.\n\nWhy is the US sending additional forces?\n\nThe Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats.\n\nThe latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was \"ready to defend US forces and interests in the region\", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran.\n\nThere are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The US Patriot missile defence system (stock photo)\n\nThe Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft.\n\nOfficials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said.\n\nIran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be \"destroyed with one missile\".\n\nWhat's the state of US-Iran relations?\n\nLast year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015.\n\nUnder the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief.\n\nLast month, the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group.\n\nThe White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil.\n\nThe sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East.\n\nIran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass.\n\nEarlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed.\n\nIt also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days.\n\nEuropean powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they \"reject any ultimatums\" from Tehran to prevent its collapse.\n\nPressure or more?\n\nThe real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun.\n\nIn the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain.\n\nBut Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran.\n\nThe pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments.\n\nA difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.",

(Photo: AFP/MC3 Chris Roys)\n\nThe carrier and a B-52 bomber task force were ordered towards the Gulf, as Washington reiterated that intelligence reports suggested Iran was planning some sort of attack in the region.\n\nCENTCOM, the US forces for the Middle East and Afghanistan, said Friday on Twitter that the B-52 bombers arrived at the area of operations on May 8, without saying where they had landed.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's national security advisor John Bolton has said the deployment aimed to send a \"clear and unmistakable\" message to Iran about any attack against the US or its partners in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWashington has not elaborated on the alleged threat, drawing criticism that it is overreacting and unnecessarily driving up tensions in the region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Tehran on the latest US moves, but earlier in the week it shrugged off the carrier deployment.\n\n\"Bolton's statement is a clumsy use of an out-of-date event for psychological warfare,\" Iran's Supreme National Security Council spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said.\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS 'NOT SEEKING WAR'\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \"in response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\".\n\n\"The Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\" it said.\n\n\"The United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\"\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran's leadership.\n\nMap of Iran and region with military and economic data. (Image: AFP/Dario Ingiusto)\n\n\"What I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\"We don't want them to have nuclear weapons - not much to ask,\" he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \"swift and decisive\" US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\"Our restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\" he said, adding however: \"We do not seek war.\"\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran's nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump's renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.",

        "text": "US sends naval strike group as tensions rise with Iran\n\nWASHINGTON- Agence France-Presse\n\nThe United States is deploying an amphibious assault ship and a Patriot missile battery to bolster an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers already sent to the Gulf, ratcheting up pressure on May 11 on archfoe Iran.\n\nIn response to alleged threats from Iran, the USS Arlington, which transports marines, amphibious vehicles, conventional landing craft and rotary aircraft, and the Patriot air defence system will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier group, the Pentagon announced on May 10.\n\nThe carrier and a B-52 bomber task force were ordered towards the Gulf, as Washington reiterated that intelligence reports suggested Iran was planning some sort of attack in the region.\n\nCENTCOM, the U.S. forces for the Middle East and Afghanistan, said Friday on Twitter that the B-52 bombers arrived at the area of operations on May 8, without saying where they had landed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s national security advisor John Bolton has said the deployment aimed to send a \"clear and unmistakable\" message to Iran about any attack against the US or its partners in the region.\n\nWashington has not elaborated on the alleged threat, drawing criticism that it is overreacting and unnecessarily driving up tensions in the region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Tehran on the latest US moves, but earlier in the week it shrugged off the carrier deployment.\n\n\"Bolton\u2019s statement is a clumsy use of an out-of-date event for psychological warfare,\" Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said.\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on May 8 it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \"in response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests.\"\n\n\"The Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\" it said.\n\n\"The United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\"\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on May 9 he was open to talks with Tehran\u2019s leadership. \"What I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"We don\u2019t want them to have nuclear weapons- not much to ask,\" he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \"swift and decisive\" US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\"Our restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\" he said, adding however: \"We do not seek war.\"\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump\u2019s renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The United States is deploying an amphibious assault ship and a Patriot missile battery to bolster an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers already sent to the Gulf, ratcheting up pressure on Saturday on archfoe Iran.\n\nIn response to alleged threats from Iran, the USS Arlington, which transports marines, amphibious vehicles, conventional landing craft and rotary aircraft, and the Patriot air defence system will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier group, the Pentagon had announced on Friday.\n\nThe carrier and a B-52 bomber task force were ordered towards the Gulf, as Washington reiterated that intelligence reports suggested Iran was planning some sort of attack in the region.\n\nRead: The US keeps turning up the pressure on Iran. But to what end?\n\nUnited States Central Command (Centcom), the US forces for the Middle East and Afghanistan, said in a tweet on Friday that the B-52 bombers arrived at the area of operations on May 8, without saying where they had landed.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton has said the deployment aimed to send a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d message to Iran about any attack against the US or its partners in the region.\n\nWashington has not elaborated on the alleged threat, drawing criticism that it is overreacting and unnecessarily driving up tensions in the region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Tehran on the latest US moves, but earlier in the week it shrugged off the carrier deployment.\n\n\u201cBolton's statement is a clumsy use of an out-of-date event for psychological warfare,\u201d Iran's Supreme National Security Council spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said.\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS 'not seeking war'\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \u201cin response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\u201d\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran's leadership.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe don't want them to have nuclear weapons \u2014 not much to ask,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \u201cswift and decisive\u201d US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\u201cOur restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\u201d he said, adding however: \u201cWe do not seek war.\u201d\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the US out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran's nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump's renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.",

Source: SIPA USA/PA Images\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS \u2018not seeking war\u2019\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \u201cin response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\u201d it said.\n\nThe United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to have nuclear weapons \u2013 not much to ask,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \u201cswift and decisive\u201d US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\u201cOur restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\u201d he said, adding however: \u201cWe do not seek war.\u201d\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump\u2019s renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2019",

Source: SIPA USA/PA Images\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS \u2018not seeking war\u2019\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \u201cin response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\u201d it said.\n\nThe United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to have nuclear weapons \u2013 not much to ask,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \u201cswift and decisive\u201d US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\u201cOur restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\u201d he said, adding however: \u201cWe do not seek war.\u201d\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump\u2019s renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2019",

        "text": "Trump's North Korea diplomacy looks troubled. It may not mean war\n\nPresident Donald Trump's attempt to make a \"great deal\" with North Korea over its nuclear program appears increasingly in peril as Kim Jong Un has ordered new missile tests and directed his country's military \"to cope with any emergency.\"\n\n\"Nobody's happy,\" Trump said Thursday after North Korea launched short-range missiles for the second time in less than a week. On Friday, Kim told his forces to be on high alert after the U.S. seized a large cargo ship that was attempting to smuggle coal out of North Korea in violation of United Nations Security Council sanctions.\n\n\"(Kim) stressed the need to further increase the capability of the defense units in the forefront area and on the western front to carry out combat tasks and keep full combat posture,\" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), a state media outlet that rarely quotes Pyongyang's leader directly, reported. KCNA said Kim \"set forth important tasks for further increasing the strike ability\" of North Korea's weapon systems.\n\nDiplomacy?: North Korea launches second projectile in less than a week\n\nAnalysts said the implications for Trump's diplomatic efforts at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula were not entirely clear, and that while North Korea's escalating rhetoric and military preparedness did not signal war, it showed how far apart the two nations were after two historic summits between Trump and North Korea's leader.\n\n\"These new developments show that neither country is able to sustain any kind of negotiation beyond the summits,\" said Waheguru Pal Singh, a defense and foreign policy expert at New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation, who has also consulted for the United Nations on international peace and security issues.\n\n\"For me, the key marker will be if the U.S. resumes joint military exercises with South Korea, and how the North reacts,\" he said, referring to longstanding annual large-scale Washington-Seoul military drills Trump ended in March to reduce tensions.\n\nAbout 28,000 U.S. troops plus thousands more family members and Department of Defense employees are stationed in South Korea, and their presence, and the joint military exercises, have for years been a source of North Korean anger.\n\nThe projectiles North Korea launched Saturday, and then Thursday, were the first since Pyongyang paused missile launches in late 2017. All splash-landed in the Pacific.\n\nTrump has refused to yield to North Korean demands to lift economic sanctions.\n\nSanctions no-no:U.S. seizes North Korea cargo ship linked to exporting tons of coal\n\nSouth Korea and U.S. intelligence analysts are still examining the missiles, but Michael Elleman, a missile defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank with offices in London and Washington, said they resemble the Russian-designed Iskander, which has a range of about 200 miles and can fit a warhead.\n\n\"Iskander can exploit gaps in South Korean and American missile-defense coverage,\" Elleman wrote in a blog post on 38 North, a Koreas-focused website.\n\nThere was further evidence that North Korea may be ramping up its military capabilities even as the Trump administration has insisted the president has maintained a good relationship with Kim despite summits in Singapore and Vietnam that ended with no tangible denuclearization steps for Pyongyang.\n\nOn Thursday night, Beyond Parallel, a program affiliated with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a global affairs think tank, published new satellite images that appeared to show that North Korea has been secretly operating a missile base that it has never previously disclosed.\n\nIn its analysis of the images, Beyond Parallel said that, though unconfirmed, the \"Yusang-ni\" base may house intercontinental ballistic missiles with a \"first strike\" capability against targets located throughout East Asia, the Pacific and the U.S.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has previously said that any missile tests by North Korea involving long-range or intercontinental missiles would be a diplomatic red line.\n\n\"It is evident that Trump's diplomatic strategy has reached an impasse,\" said Richard Caplan, a professor of international relations at Oxford University, England. \"And trade frictions with China mean that he can't count on Beijing to rein Kim in,\" he added, referring to fraught trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.\n\nNorth Korea relies on China for aid, fuel and other imports. Beijing has acted as a buffer between Pyongyang, a close ally, and Washington. Beijing's escalating trade war with Washington may make it feel less inclined to act as a referee.\n\nTrade war: U.S., China break off latest trade talks without announcing deal\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is embroiled in another front: Iran.\n\nThe White House has increasingly appeared to risk military confrontation with Tehran following U.S. and Israeli intelligence warnings that Iran or its proxies could be planning attacks on U.S. troops and facilities in the Middle East.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said it was adding a missile defense system and warship to the aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers it has already sent to the Persian Gulf to meet any Iranian threats. \"It's important that Iran understand that an attack on Americans or our interests would be met with an appropriate response,\" said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. He said the threats were credible.\n\nYet the vast majority of Iran-watchers and experts have accused the Trump administration, in particular Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, of potentially inflating the intelligence because of an almost obsessive dislike for Iran.\n\n\"Trump is treating North Korea as if it has no nuclear weapons, and Iran as if it does,\" said Singh, the defense expert at New York University, referring to what he said was the president's apparent willingness to take Kim at his word that he wants to denuclearize while ignoring repeated verifications from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that Tehran has been complying with the 2015 nuclear accord Trump withdrew the U.S. from. \"It's a very unorthodox approach,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Download the USA TODAY app",

Beijing has acted as a buffer between Pyongyang, a close ally, and Washington. Beijing's escalating trade war with Washington may make it feel less inclined to act as a referee.\n\nTrade war: U.S., China break off latest trade talks without announcing deal\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is embroiled in another front: Iran.\n\nThe White House has increasingly appeared to risk military confrontation with Tehran following U.S. and Israeli intelligence warnings that Iran or its proxies could be planning attacks on U.S. troops and facilities in the Middle East.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said it was adding a missile defense system and warship to the aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers it has already sent to the Persian Gulf to meet any Iranian threats. \"It's important that Iran understand that an attack on Americans or our interests would be met with an appropriate response,\" said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. He said the threats were credible.\n\nYet the vast majority of Iran-watchers and experts have accused the Trump administration, in particular Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, of potentially inflating the intelligence because of an almost obsessive dislike for Iran.\n\n\"Trump is treating North Korea as if it has no nuclear weapons, and Iran as if it does,\" said Singh, the defense expert at New York University, referring to what he said was the president's apparent willingness to take Kim at his word that he wants to denuclearize while ignoring repeated verifications from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that Tehran has been complying with the 2015 nuclear accord Trump withdrew the U.S. from. \"It's a very unorthodox approach,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Download the USA TODAY app",

The plan called for their combined $40 million in penalties to be distributed to affected shareholders. He told his Twitter followers in August of that year he secured \u201cfunding\u201d to take the company private at $420 per share, far more than the company was worth at the time of the tweet.\n\nThe court date is set for Oct. 22. Tesla has not yet responded to The Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFollow Chris White on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
