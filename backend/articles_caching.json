        "text": "US reportedly opposed deal, which follows concerns that villages in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia had \u2018turned into dumpsites\u2019\n\nAlmost all the world\u2019s countries have agreed on a deal aimed at restricting shipments of hard-to-recycle plastic waste to poorer countries, the United Nations announced on Friday.\n\nExporting countries \u2013 including the US \u2013 now will have to obtain consent from countries receiving contaminated, mixed or unrecyclable plastic waste. Currently, the US and other countries can send lower-quality plastic waste to private entities in developing countries without getting approval from their governments.\n\nSince China stopped accepting recycling from the US, activists say they have observed plastic waste piling up in developing countries. The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (Gaia), a backer of the deal, says it found villages in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia that had \u201cturned into dumpsites over the course of a year\u201d.\n\nRunaway consumption: 2tn drinks containers being used every year Read more\n\n\u201cWe were finding that there was waste from the US that was just piled up in villages throughout these countries that had once been primarily agricultural communities,\u201d said Claire Arkin, a spokeswoman for Gaia.\n\n\n\nThe legally binding framework emerged at the end of a two-week meeting of UN-backed conventions on plastic waste and toxic, hazardous chemicals that threaten the planet\u2019s seas and creatures. The pact comes in an amendment to the Basel convention. The US is not a party to that convention so it did not have a vote, but attendees at the meeting said the country argued against the change, saying officials didn\u2019t understand the repercussions it would have on the plastic waste trade.\n\nPlastic debris clutters pristine land, floats in huge masses in oceans and entangles and endangers wildlife. Less valuable and harder to recycle plastic is likely to end up discarded rather than turned into new products. The deal affects products used in a broad array of industries, such as healthcare, technology, aerospace, fashion and food and beverages.\n\nRolph Payet of the United Nations Environment Program called the agreement \u2013 signed by 187 countries in Geneva, Switzerland, under the convention \u2013 \u201chistoric\u201d, because countries will have to monitor where plastic waste goes when it leaves their borders. Payet said the negotiations, which began 11 days ago and brought together 1,400 delegates, had gone much further than anticipated.\n\nHe compared plastic pollution to an \u201cepidemic\u201d, with \u201can estimated 100m tonnes of plastic [110m US tons] now found in the oceans, 80 to 90% of which comes from land-based sources\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man carries plastic bottles for recycling in Nairobi, Kenya. Photograph: Ben Curtis/AP\n\nThe Basel convention sets rules for first-world countries shipping hazardous waste to less wealthy nations. Backers say the amendment will make the global trade in plastic waste more transparent and better regulated, protecting humans and the environment.\n\nThe US and other countries now will not be able to send the plastic waste to developing countries that are part of the Basel convention and are not part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a press release from major advocacy organizations explained.\n\nOfficials attributed the progress partly to growing public awareness \u2013 reinforced by documentary films by the British naturalist Sir David Attenborough and others \u2013 of the dangers of plastic pollution, especially to marine life.\n\n\u201cIt was those iconic images of the dead albatross chicks on the Pacific Islands with their stomachs open and all recognizable plastic items inside it, and most recently, it\u2019s been when we discovered the nano-particles do cross the blood-brain barrier, and we were able to prove that plastic is in us,\u201d said Paul Rose, expedition leader for the National Geographic \u201cpristine seas\u201d expeditions, aimed at protecting the oceans.\n\nRecent images that went viral of dead whales washing up with hundreds of pounds of plastic garbage in their stomachs also widely shocked the public. A new online petition entitled \u201cStop dumping plastic in paradise!\u201d has attracted almost a million signatures in the past week.\n\nThe new rules will take a year to come into force.\n\nVon Hernandez, global coordinator for Break Free from Plastic, said the deal is \u201ca crucial first step towards stopping the use of developing countries as a dumping ground for the world\u2019s plastic waste, especially those coming from rich nations\u201d.\n\nMarco Lambertini, director general of the environmental and wildlife charity WWF International, said the accord is a welcome step and that for too long wealthy countries have abdicated responsibility for enormous quantities of plastic waste.\n\n\u201cHowever, it only goes part of the way. What we \u2013 and the planet \u2013 need is a comprehensive treaty to tackle the global plastic crisis,\u201d Lambertini added.\n\n",

        "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The USS Arlington will join the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf\n\nThe US is sending a Patriot missile-defence system to the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.\n\nA warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf.\n\nAnd US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense.\n\nTehran has described the deployments as \"psychological warfare\" aimed at intimidating the country.\n\nIran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities.\n\nWhy is the US sending additional forces?\n\nThe Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats.\n\nThe latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was \"ready to defend US forces and interests in the region\", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran.\n\nThere are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The US Patriot missile defence system (stock photo)\n\nThe Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft.\n\nOfficials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said.\n\nIran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be \"destroyed with one missile\".\n\nWhat's the state of US-Iran relations?\n\nLast year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015.\n\nUnder the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief.\n\nLast month, the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group.\n\nThe White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil.\n\nThe sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East.\n\nIran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass.\n\nEarlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed.\n\nIt also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days.\n\nEuropean powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they \"reject any ultimatums\" from Tehran to prevent its collapse.\n\nPressure or more?\n\nThe real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun.\n\nIn the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain.\n\nBut Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran.\n\nThe pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments.\n\nA difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.",

            "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The USS Arlington will join the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Gulf\n\nThe US is sending a Patriot missile-defence system to the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.\n\nA warship, USS Arlington, with amphibious vehicles and aircraft on board, will also join the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Gulf.\n\nAnd US B-52 bombers have arrived at a base in Qatar, the Pentagon said.\n\nThe US said the moves were a response to a possible threat to US forces in the region by Iran, without specifying. Iran dismissed the claim as nonsense.\n\nTehran has described the deployments as \"psychological warfare\" aimed at intimidating the country.\n\nIran has also suggested it may resume uranium enrichment nuclear activities.\n\nWhy is the US sending additional forces?\n\nThe Pentagon says US forces are responding to a possible threat to US forces, but did not offer any specifics regarding those threats.\n\nThe latest Pentagon statement on Friday said only that Washington was \"ready to defend US forces and interests in the region\", adding that the US did not seek conflict with Iran.\n\nThere are about 5,200 US troops currently deployed in neighbouring Iraq.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The US Patriot missile defence system (stock photo)\n\nThe Patriot system can counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft.\n\nOfficials told US media the USS Arlington had already been scheduled to go to the region, but its deployment was brought forward to provide enhanced command and control capabilities.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln passed through the Suez Canal on Thursday, US Central Command said.\n\nIran's semi-official Isna news agency quoted a senior Iranian cleric, Yousef Tabatabai-Nejad, as saying that the US military fleet could be \"destroyed with one missile\".\n\nWhat's the state of US-Iran relations?\n\nLast year, US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal America and other nations had agreed with Iran in 2015.\n\nUnder the accord, Iran had agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief.\n\nLast month, the US also blacklisted Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it as a foreign terrorist group.\n\nThe White House proceeded to end exemptions from sanctions for five countries - China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey - that were still buying Iranian oil.\n\nThe sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a \"new deal\" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its \"malign behaviour\" across the Middle East.\n\nIran has repeatedly threatened to retaliate to the US measures by blocking the Strait of Hormuz - though which about a fifth of all oil consumed globally pass.\n\nEarlier this week Iran announced that it had suspended two commitments under the 2015 accord in response to the economic sanctions the US had re-imposed.\n\nIt also threatened to step up uranium enrichment if it was not shielded from the sanctions' effects within 60 days.\n\nEuropean powers said they remained committed to the Iran nuclear deal but that they \"reject any ultimatums\" from Tehran to prevent its collapse.\n\nPressure or more?\n\nThe real battle for the fate of the Iran nuclear deal has begun.\n\nIn the year since the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the deal, Iran and all the other parties have carried on regardless. And the International Atomic Energy Agency, the global nuclear watchdog, has repeatedly given Tehran a clean bill of health. Iran has been living up to its part of the bargain.\n\nBut Iranian compliance was not the issue for the Trump administration, which says simply that this is a bad deal. The US's main European allies, along with Russia and China, disagree. So the Trump administration has been ratcheting up the pressure on Tehran.\n\nThe pressure on Iran's economy has been severe and the Iranian government has now decided to act - saying it will no longer respect restrictions on storing enriched uranium and heavy water, and setting deadlines for the other parties to implement their commitments.\n\nA difficult couple of months of diplomacy lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. The Trump administration must see its ultimate goal - the collapse of the nuclear deal - as now being in sight. But the danger of conflict - albeit by accident rather than design - is growing.",

(Photo: AFP/MC3 Chris Roys)\n\nThe carrier and a B-52 bomber task force were ordered towards the Gulf, as Washington reiterated that intelligence reports suggested Iran was planning some sort of attack in the region.\n\nCENTCOM, the US forces for the Middle East and Afghanistan, said Friday on Twitter that the B-52 bombers arrived at the area of operations on May 8, without saying where they had landed.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's national security advisor John Bolton has said the deployment aimed to send a \"clear and unmistakable\" message to Iran about any attack against the US or its partners in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWashington has not elaborated on the alleged threat, drawing criticism that it is overreacting and unnecessarily driving up tensions in the region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Tehran on the latest US moves, but earlier in the week it shrugged off the carrier deployment.\n\n\"Bolton's statement is a clumsy use of an out-of-date event for psychological warfare,\" Iran's Supreme National Security Council spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said.\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS 'NOT SEEKING WAR'\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \"in response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\".\n\n\"The Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\" it said.\n\n\"The United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\"\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran's leadership.\n\nMap of Iran and region with military and economic data. (Image: AFP/Dario Ingiusto)\n\n\"What I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\"We don't want them to have nuclear weapons - not much to ask,\" he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \"swift and decisive\" US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\"Our restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\" he said, adding however: \"We do not seek war.\"\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran's nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump's renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.",

        "text": "US sends naval strike group as tensions rise with Iran\n\nWASHINGTON- Agence France-Presse\n\nThe United States is deploying an amphibious assault ship and a Patriot missile battery to bolster an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers already sent to the Gulf, ratcheting up pressure on May 11 on archfoe Iran.\n\nIn response to alleged threats from Iran, the USS Arlington, which transports marines, amphibious vehicles, conventional landing craft and rotary aircraft, and the Patriot air defence system will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier group, the Pentagon announced on May 10.\n\nThe carrier and a B-52 bomber task force were ordered towards the Gulf, as Washington reiterated that intelligence reports suggested Iran was planning some sort of attack in the region.\n\nCENTCOM, the U.S. forces for the Middle East and Afghanistan, said Friday on Twitter that the B-52 bombers arrived at the area of operations on May 8, without saying where they had landed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s national security advisor John Bolton has said the deployment aimed to send a \"clear and unmistakable\" message to Iran about any attack against the US or its partners in the region.\n\nWashington has not elaborated on the alleged threat, drawing criticism that it is overreacting and unnecessarily driving up tensions in the region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Tehran on the latest US moves, but earlier in the week it shrugged off the carrier deployment.\n\n\"Bolton\u2019s statement is a clumsy use of an out-of-date event for psychological warfare,\" Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said.\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on May 8 it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \"in response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests.\"\n\n\"The Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\" it said.\n\n\"The United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\"\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on May 9 he was open to talks with Tehran\u2019s leadership. \"What I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"We don\u2019t want them to have nuclear weapons- not much to ask,\" he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \"swift and decisive\" US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\"Our restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\" he said, adding however: \"We do not seek war.\"\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump\u2019s renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The United States is deploying an amphibious assault ship and a Patriot missile battery to bolster an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers already sent to the Gulf, ratcheting up pressure on Saturday on archfoe Iran.\n\nIn response to alleged threats from Iran, the USS Arlington, which transports marines, amphibious vehicles, conventional landing craft and rotary aircraft, and the Patriot air defence system will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier group, the Pentagon had announced on Friday.\n\nThe carrier and a B-52 bomber task force were ordered towards the Gulf, as Washington reiterated that intelligence reports suggested Iran was planning some sort of attack in the region.\n\nRead: The US keeps turning up the pressure on Iran. But to what end?\n\nUnited States Central Command (Centcom), the US forces for the Middle East and Afghanistan, said in a tweet on Friday that the B-52 bombers arrived at the area of operations on May 8, without saying where they had landed.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's national security adviser John Bolton has said the deployment aimed to send a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d message to Iran about any attack against the US or its partners in the region.\n\nWashington has not elaborated on the alleged threat, drawing criticism that it is overreacting and unnecessarily driving up tensions in the region.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Tehran on the latest US moves, but earlier in the week it shrugged off the carrier deployment.\n\n\u201cBolton's statement is a clumsy use of an out-of-date event for psychological warfare,\u201d Iran's Supreme National Security Council spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said.\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS 'not seeking war'\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \u201cin response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\u201d\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran's leadership.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cWe don't want them to have nuclear weapons \u2014 not much to ask,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \u201cswift and decisive\u201d US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\u201cOur restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\u201d he said, adding however: \u201cWe do not seek war.\u201d\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the US out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran's nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump's renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.",

Source: SIPA USA/PA Images\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS \u2018not seeking war\u2019\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \u201cin response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\u201d it said.\n\nThe United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to have nuclear weapons \u2013 not much to ask,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \u201cswift and decisive\u201d US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\u201cOur restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\u201d he said, adding however: \u201cWe do not seek war.\u201d\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump\u2019s renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2019",

Source: SIPA USA/PA Images\n\nThe increasing tensions come as Tehran said on Wednesday it had stopped respecting limits on its nuclear activities agreed under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nIran said it was responding to the sweeping unilateral sanctions that Washington has re-imposed since it quit the agreement one year ago, which have dealt a severe blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nUS \u2018not seeking war\u2019\n\nThe Pentagon, for its part, said the deployments were \u201cin response to indications of heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations against US forces and our interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defence continues to closely monitor the activities of the Iranian regime, their military and proxies,\u201d it said.\n\nThe United States does not seek conflict with Iran, but we are postured and ready to defend US forces and interests in the region.\n\nAmid the rising tensions, Trump said on Thursday he was open to talks with Tehran\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to see with Iran, I would like to see them call me,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want them to have nuclear weapons \u2013 not much to ask,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the latest of a series of escalating statements, however, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the same day threatened a \u201cswift and decisive\u201d US response to any attack by Iran.\n\n\u201cOur restraint to this point should not be mistaken by Iran for a lack of resolve,\u201d he said, adding however: \u201cWe do not seek war.\u201d\n\nIn May last year, Trump pulled the United States out of an agreement aimed at curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and reinstated unilateral economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would no longer implement parts of the deal and threatened to go further if the remaining members of the pact, including the European Union, failed to deliver sanctions relief to counterbalance Trump\u2019s renewed assault on the Iranian economy within 60 days.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2019",

        "text": "Trump's North Korea diplomacy looks troubled. It may not mean war\n\nPresident Donald Trump's attempt to make a \"great deal\" with North Korea over its nuclear program appears increasingly in peril as Kim Jong Un has ordered new missile tests and directed his country's military \"to cope with any emergency.\"\n\n\"Nobody's happy,\" Trump said Thursday after North Korea launched short-range missiles for the second time in less than a week. On Friday, Kim told his forces to be on high alert after the U.S. seized a large cargo ship that was attempting to smuggle coal out of North Korea in violation of United Nations Security Council sanctions.\n\n\"(Kim) stressed the need to further increase the capability of the defense units in the forefront area and on the western front to carry out combat tasks and keep full combat posture,\" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), a state media outlet that rarely quotes Pyongyang's leader directly, reported. KCNA said Kim \"set forth important tasks for further increasing the strike ability\" of North Korea's weapon systems.\n\nDiplomacy?: North Korea launches second projectile in less than a week\n\nAnalysts said the implications for Trump's diplomatic efforts at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula were not entirely clear, and that while North Korea's escalating rhetoric and military preparedness did not signal war, it showed how far apart the two nations were after two historic summits between Trump and North Korea's leader.\n\n\"These new developments show that neither country is able to sustain any kind of negotiation beyond the summits,\" said Waheguru Pal Singh, a defense and foreign policy expert at New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation, who has also consulted for the United Nations on international peace and security issues.\n\n\"For me, the key marker will be if the U.S. resumes joint military exercises with South Korea, and how the North reacts,\" he said, referring to longstanding annual large-scale Washington-Seoul military drills Trump ended in March to reduce tensions.\n\nAbout 28,000 U.S. troops plus thousands more family members and Department of Defense employees are stationed in South Korea, and their presence, and the joint military exercises, have for years been a source of North Korean anger.\n\nThe projectiles North Korea launched Saturday, and then Thursday, were the first since Pyongyang paused missile launches in late 2017. All splash-landed in the Pacific.\n\nTrump has refused to yield to North Korean demands to lift economic sanctions.\n\nSanctions no-no:U.S. seizes North Korea cargo ship linked to exporting tons of coal\n\nSouth Korea and U.S. intelligence analysts are still examining the missiles, but Michael Elleman, a missile defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank with offices in London and Washington, said they resemble the Russian-designed Iskander, which has a range of about 200 miles and can fit a warhead.\n\n\"Iskander can exploit gaps in South Korean and American missile-defense coverage,\" Elleman wrote in a blog post on 38 North, a Koreas-focused website.\n\nThere was further evidence that North Korea may be ramping up its military capabilities even as the Trump administration has insisted the president has maintained a good relationship with Kim despite summits in Singapore and Vietnam that ended with no tangible denuclearization steps for Pyongyang.\n\nOn Thursday night, Beyond Parallel, a program affiliated with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a global affairs think tank, published new satellite images that appeared to show that North Korea has been secretly operating a missile base that it has never previously disclosed.\n\nIn its analysis of the images, Beyond Parallel said that, though unconfirmed, the \"Yusang-ni\" base may house intercontinental ballistic missiles with a \"first strike\" capability against targets located throughout East Asia, the Pacific and the U.S.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has previously said that any missile tests by North Korea involving long-range or intercontinental missiles would be a diplomatic red line.\n\n\"It is evident that Trump's diplomatic strategy has reached an impasse,\" said Richard Caplan, a professor of international relations at Oxford University, England. \"And trade frictions with China mean that he can't count on Beijing to rein Kim in,\" he added, referring to fraught trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.\n\nNorth Korea relies on China for aid, fuel and other imports. Beijing has acted as a buffer between Pyongyang, a close ally, and Washington. Beijing's escalating trade war with Washington may make it feel less inclined to act as a referee.\n\nTrade war: U.S., China break off latest trade talks without announcing deal\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is embroiled in another front: Iran.\n\nThe White House has increasingly appeared to risk military confrontation with Tehran following U.S. and Israeli intelligence warnings that Iran or its proxies could be planning attacks on U.S. troops and facilities in the Middle East.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said it was adding a missile defense system and warship to the aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers it has already sent to the Persian Gulf to meet any Iranian threats. \"It's important that Iran understand that an attack on Americans or our interests would be met with an appropriate response,\" said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. He said the threats were credible.\n\nYet the vast majority of Iran-watchers and experts have accused the Trump administration, in particular Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, of potentially inflating the intelligence because of an almost obsessive dislike for Iran.\n\n\"Trump is treating North Korea as if it has no nuclear weapons, and Iran as if it does,\" said Singh, the defense expert at New York University, referring to what he said was the president's apparent willingness to take Kim at his word that he wants to denuclearize while ignoring repeated verifications from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that Tehran has been complying with the 2015 nuclear accord Trump withdrew the U.S. from. \"It's a very unorthodox approach,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Download the USA TODAY app",

Beijing has acted as a buffer between Pyongyang, a close ally, and Washington. Beijing's escalating trade war with Washington may make it feel less inclined to act as a referee.\n\nTrade war: U.S., China break off latest trade talks without announcing deal\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is embroiled in another front: Iran.\n\nThe White House has increasingly appeared to risk military confrontation with Tehran following U.S. and Israeli intelligence warnings that Iran or its proxies could be planning attacks on U.S. troops and facilities in the Middle East.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said it was adding a missile defense system and warship to the aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers it has already sent to the Persian Gulf to meet any Iranian threats. \"It's important that Iran understand that an attack on Americans or our interests would be met with an appropriate response,\" said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. He said the threats were credible.\n\nYet the vast majority of Iran-watchers and experts have accused the Trump administration, in particular Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, of potentially inflating the intelligence because of an almost obsessive dislike for Iran.\n\n\"Trump is treating North Korea as if it has no nuclear weapons, and Iran as if it does,\" said Singh, the defense expert at New York University, referring to what he said was the president's apparent willingness to take Kim at his word that he wants to denuclearize while ignoring repeated verifications from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that Tehran has been complying with the 2015 nuclear accord Trump withdrew the U.S. from. \"It's a very unorthodox approach,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Download the USA TODAY app",

The plan called for their combined $40 million in penalties to be distributed to affected shareholders. He told his Twitter followers in August of that year he secured \u201cfunding\u201d to take the company private at $420 per share, far more than the company was worth at the time of the tweet.\n\nThe court date is set for Oct. 22. Tesla has not yet responded to The Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFollow Chris White on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "opinion\n\nTrump has entered Phase 2 of his legal defense strategy: All-out war with Congress\n\nWe are seeing Phase 2 of Donald Trump\u2019s legal strategy to defend himself against government investigations. It\u2019s called, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas,\u201d and it amounts to an all-out war with Congress.\n\nIn Phase 1, Trump knew special counsel Robert Mueller could never lay a glove on him because of the Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The Phase 1 legal strategy seemed to be produce documents and witnesses so Attorney General William Barr could announce that the White House had \"fully cooperated\" \u2014 even though the president himself refused to be interviewed, no criminal charges could be filed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could proclaim \u201ccase closed.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump faces investigation from a coequal branch of government that actually could remove him from office through impeachment, the Phase 2 strategy kicks in: Fight everything.\n\nThe Mueller investigation turned out to be a fool\u2019s errand from the start. As Barr has stated repeatedly, prosecutors make \u201cbinary\u201d decisions: Charge or don\u2019t charge. Except here\u2019s the trick: When investigating a president, given DOJ policy, the only possible decision is don\u2019t charge. In other words, heads I win, tails you lose. Cooperation is easy when you can\u2019t be charged.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMueller didn't say it so we did: Trump would face felony charges if he weren't president\n\nMnuchin defies the law by withholding Trump tax returns. Congress can't let this stand.\n\nTrump administration could leave Congress no choice but an impeachment inquiry: Lieu\n\nIn Phase 2, Trump is making no pretense of cooperating. Instead, he's characterizing congressional investigations as an effort to relitigate the Mueller investigation. The fallacy of his argument is that while Mueller believed he could not charge Trump, he deferred to Congress as the appropriate body to check the president. Facts developed by Mueller may be helpful to Congress, but these investigations are different because they could result in serious consequences for the president.\n\nAn escalating accumulation of obstruction\n\nRather than cooperating, Trump has filed lawsuits to block his accounting firm and banks from complying with subpoenas to produce his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Mueller should not testify before Congress, even though Barr has said that he has no objection. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a request from House Ways and Means Committee to produce Trump\u2019s tax returns, despite a law stating that he \u201cshall furnish\u201d returns upon request.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House prohibited former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena for documents, stating that the president might want to assert executive privilege. On Wednesday, the White House asserted executive privilege over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, including statements made to investigators during interviews, for which the privilege has arguably been waived. That same day, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration is engaged in \u201ca cumulative effect of obstruction\u201d that could lead to other contempt of Congress citations.\n\nExecutive privilege is a recognized doctrine that presidents may use to protect confidential communications, national security matters and agency deliberations. DOJ has also historically asserted executive privilege to protect ongoing investigations and individuals\u2019 privacy interests. But the parameters of executive privilege are largely undefined, and the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that the privilege is a qualified one that must yield when items are subpoenaed for criminal trial. We entrust our executive branch officials to exercise the privilege judiciously to protect legitimate interests, such as fostering candid advice from aides, and not to use it as a shield to conceal misconduct.\n\n'Accommodation' is not how Trump rolls\n\nIn the past, we have counted on norms to help us avoid showdowns between branches of government, sometimes described as a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d One of these norms is the process of accommodation, in which branches of government negotiate a resolution that allows the parties to move on without court intervention. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general, William French Smith, described accommodation in a 1981 opinion as essential to responsible exercise of government power: \u201cThe accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge, and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.\u201d\n\nEven so, we all know by now that \u201caccommodation\u201d is not how Trump rolls. He is a disrupter. He is not afraid to break the norms; in fact, he thrives on it. Norm-busting is part of his appeal to his base. He does not shrink from a good fight. He has made a career of using the legal process to bully others to get his way.\n\nAnd even if Trump ultimately loses his legal battles in Phase 2, success is not necessarily defined as prevailing in court, but in delaying any resolution until after the 2020 election. Some even suggest Trump is daring congressional Democrats to impeach him, knowing that the Republican-led Senate will never convict him, and luring his opponents into a political trap that will help him win reelection.\n\nCongress must protect Constitution, not Trump\n\nThis is no way to run a government. While Trump\u2019s strategy to stonewall might help him \u201cwin,\u201d it could do long-term damage to our country. Our constitutional system is built on checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. But the system relies on people of good faith to exercise those checks and balances.\n\nFor example, the president must not just execute the law but also take care that the laws be executed \u201cfaithfully.\u201d And members of Congress owe their allegiance not just to their party but also to their country, as Republican lawmakers demonstrated during the Watergate scandal. Their oath of office swears them to support and defend the Constitution, not the president or their party.\n\nAs Trump tests the norms of government, we need members of the executive and legislative branches to overcome tribal instincts and do what\u2019s best for our nation. For members of the executive branch, that means using executive privilege on an item-by-item basis and not for blanket protection from all inquiry. And for Congress, it means using all the legal tools at its disposal \u2014 subpoenas, lawsuits and even impeachment proceedings \u2014 to conduct vigorous oversight of a president willing to break all norms.\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, is a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.

It\u2019s called, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas,\u201d and it amounts to an all-out war with Congress.\n\nIn Phase 1, Trump knew special counsel Robert Mueller could never lay a glove on him because of the Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The Phase 1 legal strategy seemed to be produce documents and witnesses so Attorney General William Barr could announce that the White House had \"fully cooperated\" \u2014 even though the president himself refused to be interviewed, no criminal charges could be filed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could proclaim \u201ccase closed.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump faces investigation from a coequal branch of government that actually could remove him from office through impeachment, the Phase 2 strategy kicks in: Fight everything.\n\nThe Mueller investigation turned out to be a fool\u2019s errand from the start. As Barr has stated repeatedly, prosecutors make \u201cbinary\u201d decisions: Charge or don\u2019t charge. Except here\u2019s the trick: When investigating a president, given DOJ policy, the only possible decision is don\u2019t charge. In other words, heads I win, tails you lose. Cooperation is easy when you can\u2019t be charged.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMueller didn't say it so we did: Trump would face felony charges if he weren't president\n\nMnuchin defies the law by withholding Trump tax returns. Congress can't let this stand.\n\nTrump administration could leave Congress no choice but an impeachment inquiry: Lieu\n\nIn Phase 2, Trump is making no pretense of cooperating. Instead, he's characterizing congressional investigations as an effort to relitigate the Mueller investigation. The fallacy of his argument is that while Mueller believed he could not charge Trump, he deferred to Congress as the appropriate body to check the president. Facts developed by Mueller may be helpful to Congress, but these investigations are different because they could result in serious consequences for the president.\n\nAn escalating accumulation of obstruction\n\nRather than cooperating, Trump has filed lawsuits to block his accounting firm and banks from complying with subpoenas to produce his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Mueller should not testify before Congress, even though Barr has said that he has no objection. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a request from House Ways and Means Committee to produce Trump\u2019s tax returns, despite a law stating that he \u201cshall furnish\u201d returns upon request.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House prohibited former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena for documents, stating that the president might want to assert executive privilege. On Wednesday, the White House asserted executive privilege over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, including statements made to investigators during interviews, for which the privilege has arguably been waived. That same day, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration is engaged in \u201ca cumulative effect of obstruction\u201d that could lead to other contempt of Congress citations.\n\nExecutive privilege is a recognized doctrine that presidents may use to protect confidential communications, national security matters and agency deliberations. DOJ has also historically asserted executive privilege to protect ongoing investigations and individuals\u2019 privacy interests. But the parameters of executive privilege are largely undefined, and the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that the privilege is a qualified one that must yield when items are subpoenaed for criminal trial. We entrust our executive branch officials to exercise the privilege judiciously to protect legitimate interests, such as fostering candid advice from aides, and not to use it as a shield to conceal misconduct.\n\n'Accommodation' is not how Trump rolls\n\nIn the past, we have counted on norms to help us avoid showdowns between branches of government, sometimes described as a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d One of these norms is the process of accommodation, in which branches of government negotiate a resolution that allows the parties to move on without court intervention. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general, William French Smith, described accommodation in a 1981 opinion as essential to responsible exercise of government power: \u201cThe accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge, and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.\u201d\n\nEven so, we all know by now that \u201caccommodation\u201d is not how Trump rolls. He is a disrupter. He is not afraid to break the norms; in fact, he thrives on it. Norm-busting is part of his appeal to his base. He does not shrink from a good fight. He has made a career of using the legal process to bully others to get his way.\n\nAnd even if Trump ultimately loses his legal battles in Phase 2, success is not necessarily defined as prevailing in court, but in delaying any resolution until after the 2020 election. Some even suggest Trump is daring congressional Democrats to impeach him, knowing that the Republican-led Senate will never convict him, and luring his opponents into a political trap that will help him win reelection.\n\nCongress must protect Constitution, not Trump\n\nThis is no way to run a government. While Trump\u2019s strategy to stonewall might help him \u201cwin,\u201d it could do long-term damage to our country. Our constitutional system is built on checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. But the system relies on people of good faith to exercise those checks and balances.\n\nFor example, the president must not just execute the law but also take care that the laws be executed \u201cfaithfully.\u201d And members of Congress owe their allegiance not just to their party but also to their country, as Republican lawmakers demonstrated during the Watergate scandal. Their oath of office swears them to support and defend the Constitution, not the president or their party.\n\nAs Trump tests the norms of government, we need members of the executive and legislative branches to overcome tribal instincts and do what\u2019s best for our nation. For members of the executive branch, that means using executive privilege on an item-by-item basis and not for blanket protection from all inquiry. And for Congress, it means using all the legal tools at its disposal \u2014 subpoenas, lawsuits and even impeachment proceedings \u2014 to conduct vigorous oversight of a president willing to break all norms.\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, is a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.

Cooperation is easy when you can\u2019t be charged.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMueller didn't say it so we did: Trump would face felony charges if he weren't president\n\nMnuchin defies the law by withholding Trump tax returns. Congress can't let this stand.\n\nTrump administration could leave Congress no choice but an impeachment inquiry: Lieu\n\nIn Phase 2, Trump is making no pretense of cooperating. Instead, he's characterizing congressional investigations as an effort to relitigate the Mueller investigation. The fallacy of his argument is that while Mueller believed he could not charge Trump, he deferred to Congress as the appropriate body to check the president. Facts developed by Mueller may be helpful to Congress, but these investigations are different because they could result in serious consequences for the president.\n\nAn escalating accumulation of obstruction\n\nRather than cooperating, Trump has filed lawsuits to block his accounting firm and banks from complying with subpoenas to produce his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Mueller should not testify before Congress, even though Barr has said that he has no objection. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a request from House Ways and Means Committee to produce Trump\u2019s tax returns, despite a law stating that he \u201cshall furnish\u201d returns upon request.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House prohibited former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena for documents, stating that the president might want to assert executive privilege. On Wednesday, the White House asserted executive privilege over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, including statements made to investigators during interviews, for which the privilege has arguably been waived. That same day, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration is engaged in \u201ca cumulative effect of obstruction\u201d that could lead to other contempt of Congress citations.\n\nExecutive privilege is a recognized doctrine that presidents may use to protect confidential communications, national security matters and agency deliberations. DOJ has also historically asserted executive privilege to protect ongoing investigations and individuals\u2019 privacy interests. But the parameters of executive privilege are largely undefined, and the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that the privilege is a qualified one that must yield when items are subpoenaed for criminal trial. We entrust our executive branch officials to exercise the privilege judiciously to protect legitimate interests, such as fostering candid advice from aides, and not to use it as a shield to conceal misconduct.\n\n'Accommodation' is not how Trump rolls\n\nIn the past, we have counted on norms to help us avoid showdowns between branches of government, sometimes described as a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d One of these norms is the process of accommodation, in which branches of government negotiate a resolution that allows the parties to move on without court intervention. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general, William French Smith, described accommodation in a 1981 opinion as essential to responsible exercise of government power: \u201cThe accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge, and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.\u201d\n\nEven so, we all know by now that \u201caccommodation\u201d is not how Trump rolls. He is a disrupter. He is not afraid to break the norms; in fact, he thrives on it. Norm-busting is part of his appeal to his base. He does not shrink from a good fight. He has made a career of using the legal process to bully others to get his way.\n\nAnd even if Trump ultimately loses his legal battles in Phase 2, success is not necessarily defined as prevailing in court, but in delaying any resolution until after the 2020 election. Some even suggest Trump is daring congressional Democrats to impeach him, knowing that the Republican-led Senate will never convict him, and luring his opponents into a political trap that will help him win reelection.\n\nCongress must protect Constitution, not Trump\n\nThis is no way to run a government. While Trump\u2019s strategy to stonewall might help him \u201cwin,\u201d it could do long-term damage to our country. Our constitutional system is built on checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. But the system relies on people of good faith to exercise those checks and balances.\n\nFor example, the president must not just execute the law but also take care that the laws be executed \u201cfaithfully.\u201d And members of Congress owe their allegiance not just to their party but also to their country, as Republican lawmakers demonstrated during the Watergate scandal. Their oath of office swears them to support and defend the Constitution, not the president or their party.\n\nAs Trump tests the norms of government, we need members of the executive and legislative branches to overcome tribal instincts and do what\u2019s best for our nation. For members of the executive branch, that means using executive privilege on an item-by-item basis and not for blanket protection from all inquiry. And for Congress, it means using all the legal tools at its disposal \u2014 subpoenas, lawsuits and even impeachment proceedings \u2014 to conduct vigorous oversight of a president willing to break all norms.\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, is a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.

        "publishDate": "2019-05-04 21:52:14+00:00",
        "text": "By Iqbal Jassat\n\nIf America\u2019s standing in the globe as the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d has been on shaky grounds following its disastrous wars post-9/11, US president Donald Trump has ensured that whatever little credibility it may still have enjoyed among European allies and the United Nations, is totally ruined.\n\nHis messy and bloody military adventure in Libya via the CIA-trained General Haftar, is reflective of the growing alienation with international conventions his administration is being viewed with.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to finance and equip Haftar with sophisticated weapons including fighter jets, has met with fierce resistance from the UN-recognized government. That the military attempt via a bloody coup to install Haftar has failed thus far, the ongoing bloodletting is further indication that Trump will defiantly pursue his regime-change agenda regardless of innocent lives being lost.\n\nPolicies of lose-lose have characterized Trump since his inception and if the electoral strength of his rightwing white supremacists persists, his second term may turn out to be worse. America\u2019s leadership will remain firmly stuck in the hands of neocons and Israel\u2019s equally racist colonialists.\n\nTrumpism has outstripped Machiavellism. And unlike the false sophistry of previous administrations particularly that of Clinton and Obama, Trump\u2019s buffoonery is blatantly associated with visible layers of arrogance, deceit, corruption and disdain.\n\nHis illegal intervention in Venezuela is further evidence of rampant power gone astray. It is to be expected of hoodlums, which is what Trump\u2019s gung-ho meddling in the affairs of other nations defines him as.\n\nVenezuela has been engulfed with a civil war as Trump\u2019s men put the squeeze on the military to abandon President Maduro.\n\nRightwing hawks including John Bolton have demanded that senior military officials pull the rug to allow US-backed Guaido to assume power and control of the oil-rich country. A coup is underway whether the world likes it or not, is the blunt message emanating from the White House.\n\nApart from creating civil strife in Libya and Venezuela, Trump\u2019s mafia-type operation can also be gauged by his apparent blackmailing of Ecuador.\n\nThe case of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and how Ecuador traded him for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), illustrates the danger to whistleblowers resulting from Washington\u2019s control of the IMF.\n\nYou can\u2019t get an IMF loan unless the United States (read Donald Trump) approves it \u2013 upon agreement to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy.\n\nUS military involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen, under the direct command of Trump, is another case in point. Though Congress voted in favor of a resolution to end US support, Trump vetoed it. His calculation is obviously based on the trade-offs he can and has secured with Saudi crown prince Mohamed bin Salman (MbS).\n\nNow that a new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the US-backed Saudi war of aggression on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previous assessments, its left to be seen whether Congress will vote to overturn Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nWhile it appears that American-based commentators, who by the way are a tickey-a-dozen on CNN, FOX and most media outlets, are pitted against each other in attempts to either rationalize or ridicule Trump\u2019s actions, the Donald show moves on in a blaze of fiery rhetoric and unilateral action.\n\nRecently Trump made one of his trademark boisterous remarks about Saudi Arabia, claiming he warned King Salman he would not last in power for \u201ctwo weeks\u201d without the backing of the US military.\n\nWhile it may be undiplomatic, the House of Saud knows only too well that it is true.\n\nNot only is it a confirmation of the devastating reach American imperialism has, but it also says to the world that Trump and his group of thugs do not care about respecting civilized values.\n\nIn the case of Iran, Trump has boasted that not only does he trust Netanyahu\u2019s allegations despite his own intelligence agencies disputing Israel\u2019s so-called \u201cevidence\u201d, but he is also willing to sacrifice American soldiers on behalf of Zionist ideals.\n\nSanctions against Iran coupled with threats of a full-scale war, in abject compliance with Israel\u2019s dictates, have the potential to plunge the world to levels of unprecedented chaos and instability. Consequences of it hold the promise of a horror movie, except that it will be a reality.\n\nTrump\u2019s unilateral decision to break out of Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement has not been favorably met by Europe. But Trump\u2019s recklessness knows no bounds. That he has done so to satisfy Netanyahu, with the full knowledge of turning his administration into a pariah in the eyes of European signatories is not a secret.\n\nTrump\u2019s disdain for international conventions and humanitarian laws is unfortunately not only confined to the countries and regions mentioned above. His outrageous assault on Palestinian rights confirms how repugnant and depraved Trump\u2019s administration is.\n\nTo bring Palestinians into line, and to force a Saudi-backed Bantustan leadership to accept whatever bizarre version of \u2018peace\u2019 Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner has plotted in league with Netanyahu, Trump has taken several steps aimed at intimidating the PA.\n\nThese include the cutting of $200 million in direct aid to Gaza and the West Bank and the freezing of another $300 million dollars provided annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).\n\nTo illustrate how determined Trump is to reign as America\u2019s undisputed rogue leader, look no further than his arbitrary decree to \u201cgrant\u201d Jerusalem, the Golan and now the Occupied West Bank to the region\u2019s colonial settler regime Israel. A foreign intervention which not only defies UNSC resolutions but also \u201cgifts\u201d Netanyahu what he and fellow Zionists plotted to expand Israel\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise.\n\nTrump\u2019s single-minded goal to reshape the world in his image will ultimately become his albatross. But until then, fueling wars and conflicts in pursuance of undisguised white supremacist hegemony will continue to take a toll on human lives.\n\n\u2013 Iqbal Jassat is an Executive Member of the South Africa-based Media Review Network.

            "text": "By Iqbal Jassat\n\nIf America\u2019s standing in the globe as the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d has been on shaky grounds following its disastrous wars post-9/11, US president Donald Trump has ensured that whatever little credibility it may still have enjoyed among European allies and the United Nations, is totally ruined.\n\nHis messy and bloody military adventure in Libya via the CIA-trained General Haftar, is reflective of the growing alienation with international conventions his administration is being viewed with.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to finance and equip Haftar with sophisticated weapons including fighter jets, has met with fierce resistance from the UN-recognized government. That the military attempt via a bloody coup to install Haftar has failed thus far, the ongoing bloodletting is further indication that Trump will defiantly pursue his regime-change agenda regardless of innocent lives being lost.\n\nPolicies of lose-lose have characterized Trump since his inception and if the electoral strength of his rightwing white supremacists persists, his second term may turn out to be worse. America\u2019s leadership will remain firmly stuck in the hands of neocons and Israel\u2019s equally racist colonialists.\n\nTrumpism has outstripped Machiavellism. And unlike the false sophistry of previous administrations particularly that of Clinton and Obama, Trump\u2019s buffoonery is blatantly associated with visible layers of arrogance, deceit, corruption and disdain.\n\nHis illegal intervention in Venezuela is further evidence of rampant power gone astray. It is to be expected of hoodlums, which is what Trump\u2019s gung-ho meddling in the affairs of other nations defines him as.\n\nVenezuela has been engulfed with a civil war as Trump\u2019s men put the squeeze on the military to abandon President Maduro.\n\nRightwing hawks including John Bolton have demanded that senior military officials pull the rug to allow US-backed Guaido to assume power and control of the oil-rich country. A coup is underway whether the world likes it or not, is the blunt message emanating from the White House.\n\nApart from creating civil strife in Libya and Venezuela, Trump\u2019s mafia-type operation can also be gauged by his apparent blackmailing of Ecuador.\n\nThe case of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and how Ecuador traded him for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), illustrates the danger to whistleblowers resulting from Washington\u2019s control of the IMF.\n\nYou can\u2019t get an IMF loan unless the United States (read Donald Trump) approves it \u2013 upon agreement to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy.\n\nUS military involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen, under the direct command of Trump, is another case in point. Though Congress voted in favor of a resolution to end US support, Trump vetoed it. His calculation is obviously based on the trade-offs he can and has secured with Saudi crown prince Mohamed bin Salman (MbS).\n\nNow that a new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the US-backed Saudi war of aggression on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previous assessments, its left to be seen whether Congress will vote to overturn Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nWhile it appears that American-based commentators, who by the way are a tickey-a-dozen on CNN, FOX and most media outlets, are pitted against each other in attempts to either rationalize or ridicule Trump\u2019s actions, the Donald show moves on in a blaze of fiery rhetoric and unilateral action.\n\nRecently Trump made one of his trademark boisterous remarks about Saudi Arabia, claiming he warned King Salman he would not last in power for \u201ctwo weeks\u201d without the backing of the US military.\n\nWhile it may be undiplomatic, the House of Saud knows only too well that it is true.\n\nNot only is it a confirmation of the devastating reach American imperialism has, but it also says to the world that Trump and his group of thugs do not care about respecting civilized values.\n\nIn the case of Iran, Trump has boasted that not only does he trust Netanyahu\u2019s allegations despite his own intelligence agencies disputing Israel\u2019s so-called \u201cevidence\u201d, but he is also willing to sacrifice American soldiers on behalf of Zionist ideals.\n\nSanctions against Iran coupled with threats of a full-scale war, in abject compliance with Israel\u2019s dictates, have the potential to plunge the world to levels of unprecedented chaos and instability. Consequences of it hold the promise of a horror movie, except that it will be a reality.\n\nTrump\u2019s unilateral decision to break out of Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement has not been favorably met by Europe. But Trump\u2019s recklessness knows no bounds. That he has done so to satisfy Netanyahu, with the full knowledge of turning his administration into a pariah in the eyes of European signatories is not a secret.\n\nTrump\u2019s disdain for international conventions and humanitarian laws is unfortunately not only confined to the countries and regions mentioned above. His outrageous assault on Palestinian rights confirms how repugnant and depraved Trump\u2019s administration is.\n\nTo bring Palestinians into line, and to force a Saudi-backed Bantustan leadership to accept whatever bizarre version of \u2018peace\u2019 Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner has plotted in league with Netanyahu, Trump has taken several steps aimed at intimidating the PA.\n\nThese include the cutting of $200 million in direct aid to Gaza and the West Bank and the freezing of another $300 million dollars provided annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).\n\nTo illustrate how determined Trump is to reign as America\u2019s undisputed rogue leader, look no further than his arbitrary decree to \u201cgrant\u201d Jerusalem, the Golan and now the Occupied West Bank to the region\u2019s colonial settler regime Israel. A foreign intervention which not only defies UNSC resolutions but also \u201cgifts\u201d Netanyahu what he and fellow Zionists plotted to expand Israel\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise.\n\nTrump\u2019s single-minded goal to reshape the world in his image will ultimately become his albatross. But until then, fueling wars and conflicts in pursuance of undisguised white supremacist hegemony will continue to take a toll on human lives.\n\n\u2013 Iqbal Jassat is an Executive Member of the South Africa-based Media Review Network.

        "text": "The Trump administration has declared the most severe new sanctions against Cuba since President John F Kennedy imposed an economic embargo banning all trade with the communist island in 1962.\n\nSpeaking in Miami on April 17, the anniversary of the United States\u2019 failed 1961 invasion of Cuba\u2019s Bay of Pigs, National Security Adviser John Bolton announced the end of virtually all non-family travel to Cuba and placed new limits on the money Cuban Americans can send to family on the island.\n\nHe also said the US will now implement a 23-year-old law aimed at blocking both US and foreign investment in Cuba, first passed by Congress in 1996 as part of a broader sanctions package against Cuba but put on hold because it triggered immense opposition among US allies.\n\nThe harsh new sanctions reverse \u201cthe disastrous Obama-era policies, and finally end the glamourisation of socialism and communism\u201d, Bolton said.\n\nA law too controversial to implement\n\nTrump\u2019s decision activates a long-suspended 1996 provision of US Cuba sanctions that allows Cuban Americans to sue in US courts any company that benefits from private property of theirs confiscated by Fidel Castro\u2019s regime.\n\nNormally, US courts have no jurisdiction over property owned by non-citizens that is nationalised by a foreign government. For US courts to sit in judgment of another government\u2019s actions toward its own citizens in its own territory is a challenge to that government\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nUS allies who do business with Cuba vehemently oppose the move.\n\nIn 1996, when the US law was first approved, the European Union filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation and adopted a law prohibiting EU members and their companies from complying with the US legislation. Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom soon passed similar legislation.\n\nIn response, President Bill Clinton suspended the lawsuit provision, which is called Title III, for six months, and in 1998 he signed an agreement with the EU that European companies who do business in Cuba would not be targeted.\n\nSince then, every president, Democrat and Republican, has renewed the suspension. Trump himself renewed it three times \u2013 until he didn\u2019t.\n\nThe president has now reignited international outrage over this sanction, which abrogates Clinton\u2019s agreement with the EU and complicates already rocky US relations with Mexico and Canada.\n\nWho wins?\n\nA small but elite community stands to benefit from Title III: Cuba\u2019s former one percenters \u2013 members of the exiled upper class that owned nearly all the land and business in Cuba prior to the 1959 Cuban Revolution.\n\nMost wealthy Cubans fled the country after Fidel Castro\u2019s Communist government nationalized their businesses and confiscated their homes, bank accounts and property. Some still dream of recouping their lost fortunes.\n\nThey can now sue Cuban, American and foreign companies that profit in any way from the use of that property.\n\nFor example, former owners of Cuba\u2019s nickel mines could seek damages from Canada\u2019s Sherritt International Corporation, which has invested in Cuba\u2019s nickel mining industry. The former owners of Cuban hotels could sue the Spanish hotel company Melia, which manages hotels across the island.\n\nEvery US and foreign company that does business with Cuba \u2013 or might do so in the future \u2013 risks being sued if they make use of property once owned by a Cuban exile who is now a US citizen. According to a 1996 State Department analysis, implementing Title III could flood US federal courts with as many as 200,000 lawsuits.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2020 bet\n\nMost Cuban Americans will gain nothing from Trump\u2019s latest sanctions.\n\nIt exempts private residences from compensation. So, if the main thing you owned back in Cuba was a house that was confiscated after Jan. 1, 1959, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nThe exiled owners of thousands of small Cuban mom-and-pop shops nationalised in 1968 won\u2019t see compensation, either, because the law exempts Cuban small businesses that were confiscated.\n\nThose who stand to benefit are the oldest, most conservative and wealthiest segment of Florida\u2019s 1.5 million Cuban Americans.\n\nTrump believes these influential Republicans helped him win Florida in 2016 because he promised to take a hard line toward Havana, rolling back President Obama\u2019s restoration of diplomatic and economic relations with the island.\n\nIf the president thinks these punishing new sanctions can deliver Florida to him again in 2020, he may have miscalculated.\n\nI\u2019ve studied Cuba-US relations for decades. While activating the law may please Cuba\u2019s former wealthy business owners, Trump\u2019s new sanctions \u2013 like limiting the money Cuban Americans can send back to the island \u2013 are unlikely to be popular in the broader Cuban American community.\n\nBy decisive majorities, Cuban Americans support free travel between the US and Cuba, broader commercial ties and President Obama\u2019s decision to normalise relations. Every year, they send $3 billion to family on the island, and hundreds of thousands of them travel there to visit.\n\nThese Cuban-American voters don\u2019t want to inflict more economic pain on the Cuban public, which includes their friends and family.\n\nHurting everyday Cubans\n\nThe punitive aspects of the newly implemented law, which administration officials have for months hinted that they would put into effect, are already having an impact.\n\nCuban American families who owned the land and facilities at the port of Havana and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport have warned the cruise ship companies and airlines that their use of these properties could put them at legal risk.\n\nThe Bacardi company\u2019s Cuban assets, including this headquarters in Havana, were seized by the government of Fidel Castro in the 1960s. Photo credit: Stringer/Reuters\n\nAlong with money sent from their families abroad, tourism-related income sustains many everyday Cubans.\n\nIf travel businesses withdraw from Cuba, and if US and foreign firms hesitate to enter into new commercial relations with Cuba for fear of incurring lawsuits in the United States, Cuba\u2019s already fragile economy would take a serious hit.\n\nThat may play well with Cuba\u2019s old elite. But the rest of Florida\u2019s Cuban Americans will feel the hurt, too.\n\nWilliam M.

            "text": "The Trump administration has declared the most severe new sanctions against Cuba since President John F Kennedy imposed an economic embargo banning all trade with the communist island in 1962.\n\nSpeaking in Miami on April 17, the anniversary of the United States\u2019 failed 1961 invasion of Cuba\u2019s Bay of Pigs, National Security Adviser John Bolton announced the end of virtually all non-family travel to Cuba and placed new limits on the money Cuban Americans can send to family on the island.\n\nHe also said the US will now implement a 23-year-old law aimed at blocking both US and foreign investment in Cuba, first passed by Congress in 1996 as part of a broader sanctions package against Cuba but put on hold because it triggered immense opposition among US allies.\n\nThe harsh new sanctions reverse \u201cthe disastrous Obama-era policies, and finally end the glamourisation of socialism and communism\u201d, Bolton said.\n\nA law too controversial to implement\n\nTrump\u2019s decision activates a long-suspended 1996 provision of US Cuba sanctions that allows Cuban Americans to sue in US courts any company that benefits from private property of theirs confiscated by Fidel Castro\u2019s regime.\n\nNormally, US courts have no jurisdiction over property owned by non-citizens that is nationalised by a foreign government. For US courts to sit in judgment of another government\u2019s actions toward its own citizens in its own territory is a challenge to that government\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nUS allies who do business with Cuba vehemently oppose the move.\n\nIn 1996, when the US law was first approved, the European Union filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation and adopted a law prohibiting EU members and their companies from complying with the US legislation. Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom soon passed similar legislation.\n\nIn response, President Bill Clinton suspended the lawsuit provision, which is called Title III, for six months, and in 1998 he signed an agreement with the EU that European companies who do business in Cuba would not be targeted.\n\nSince then, every president, Democrat and Republican, has renewed the suspension. Trump himself renewed it three times \u2013 until he didn\u2019t.\n\nThe president has now reignited international outrage over this sanction, which abrogates Clinton\u2019s agreement with the EU and complicates already rocky US relations with Mexico and Canada.\n\nWho wins?\n\nA small but elite community stands to benefit from Title III: Cuba\u2019s former one percenters \u2013 members of the exiled upper class that owned nearly all the land and business in Cuba prior to the 1959 Cuban Revolution.\n\nMost wealthy Cubans fled the country after Fidel Castro\u2019s Communist government nationalized their businesses and confiscated their homes, bank accounts and property. Some still dream of recouping their lost fortunes.\n\nThey can now sue Cuban, American and foreign companies that profit in any way from the use of that property.\n\nFor example, former owners of Cuba\u2019s nickel mines could seek damages from Canada\u2019s Sherritt International Corporation, which has invested in Cuba\u2019s nickel mining industry. The former owners of Cuban hotels could sue the Spanish hotel company Melia, which manages hotels across the island.\n\nEvery US and foreign company that does business with Cuba \u2013 or might do so in the future \u2013 risks being sued if they make use of property once owned by a Cuban exile who is now a US citizen. According to a 1996 State Department analysis, implementing Title III could flood US federal courts with as many as 200,000 lawsuits.\n\nTrump\u2019s 2020 bet\n\nMost Cuban Americans will gain nothing from Trump\u2019s latest sanctions.\n\nIt exempts private residences from compensation. So, if the main thing you owned back in Cuba was a house that was confiscated after Jan. 1, 1959, you\u2019re out of luck.\n\nThe exiled owners of thousands of small Cuban mom-and-pop shops nationalised in 1968 won\u2019t see compensation, either, because the law exempts Cuban small businesses that were confiscated.\n\nThose who stand to benefit are the oldest, most conservative and wealthiest segment of Florida\u2019s 1.5 million Cuban Americans.\n\nTrump believes these influential Republicans helped him win Florida in 2016 because he promised to take a hard line toward Havana, rolling back President Obama\u2019s restoration of diplomatic and economic relations with the island.\n\nIf the president thinks these punishing new sanctions can deliver Florida to him again in 2020, he may have miscalculated.\n\nI\u2019ve studied Cuba-US relations for decades. While activating the law may please Cuba\u2019s former wealthy business owners, Trump\u2019s new sanctions \u2013 like limiting the money Cuban Americans can send back to the island \u2013 are unlikely to be popular in the broader Cuban American community.\n\nBy decisive majorities, Cuban Americans support free travel between the US and Cuba, broader commercial ties and President Obama\u2019s decision to normalise relations. Every year, they send $3 billion to family on the island, and hundreds of thousands of them travel there to visit.\n\nThese Cuban-American voters don\u2019t want to inflict more economic pain on the Cuban public, which includes their friends and family.\n\nHurting everyday Cubans\n\nThe punitive aspects of the newly implemented law, which administration officials have for months hinted that they would put into effect, are already having an impact.\n\nCuban American families who owned the land and facilities at the port of Havana and Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport have warned the cruise ship companies and airlines that their use of these properties could put them at legal risk.\n\nThe Bacardi company\u2019s Cuban assets, including this headquarters in Havana, were seized by the government of Fidel Castro in the 1960s. Photo credit: Stringer/Reuters\n\nAlong with money sent from their families abroad, tourism-related income sustains many everyday Cubans.\n\nIf travel businesses withdraw from Cuba, and if US and foreign firms hesitate to enter into new commercial relations with Cuba for fear of incurring lawsuits in the United States, Cuba\u2019s already fragile economy would take a serious hit.\n\nThat may play well with Cuba\u2019s old elite. But the rest of Florida\u2019s Cuban Americans will feel the hurt, too.\n\nWilliam M.

        "title": "Anonymous Has Declared Many 'Wars' - The Latest on Trump. Does It Matter?",
        "authors": [],
        "publishDate": "None",
        "text": "Articles about Anonymous \"declaring war\" on things are starting to become the John Oliver recaps of writing about Anonymous: It's a catchy headline; it's not, strictly speaking, factually wrong; and it often touches on issues currently in the news. So when a video emerges showing Anonymous declaring \"total war\" on Donald Trump , as one did earlier this month, people pay attention.\n\nJust as they did the last time Anonymous declared war on Trump. Or when Anonymous declared war on Isis, or the other time Anonymous declared war on Isis. Or when it declared war on the KKK. Or any of the many other war declarations in the years-long history of the hacking collective. But what the actual effect of an Anonymous \"war\" is - or, for that matter, what declaring war means in this context - is less discussed.\n\nIn the case of the most recent \"war\" against Trump, the declaration promises a couple of things: first, that the people behind this particular operation will try to take down several websites connected to the Trump in retaliation for his \"hateful\" campaign for president; second, that it will take place on April 1. And third, that if enough people participate, somehow all of this will \"dismantle\" the campaign of a man who has thrived on moments that would have politically destroyed anyone else, and \"sabotage\" his brand.\n\n(For the record, Trump seems to have survived Anonymous's successful Distributed Denial of Service attack against the Trump Towers' website in December.)\n\nIt's not that Trump doesn't make sense as an antagonist for Anonymous, the vigilante collective of activists and hackers: The candidate has floated a plan to \"close up\" parts of the Internet in order to stop terrorism; a voicemail account purported to be his was recently accessed and leaked; his position on the First Amendment appears to be, well, selective. The question is whether the DoS onslaught can achieve what is being promised -- a question causing internal disagreement among Anonymous right now.\n\nA different Anonymous-associated YouTube account released a video to \"terminate\" the anti-Trump operation on Wednesday arguing that the April 1 DoS pledge is \"nothing more than an empty message,\" urging Anonymous supporters to instead focus on changing \"the entire system.\"\n\nStill others worried inevitable ineffectiveness of the new Trump operation - given what it's promising to do - will only make Anonymous look bad.\n\nWhen Anonymous said it was going to war with Trump in that month over his advocating for a total ban on Muslims entering America, we argued that the war was largely a symptom of an \"identity crisis\" within Anonymous. The truth is, Anonymous is not, and has never been, a monolith. It was never intended to be. Instead, it's more of a gathering point of people - some old timers, some new; some dedicated, some just visiting - who work together on different, distinct operations. Sometimes, multiple operations have very similar goals and targets, but disagree strongly on the best approach to accomplish what they want. One great example of that in action? The various Anonymous and Anonymous-connected operations targeting the online influence of the Islamic State.\n\nAnonymous famously \"declared war\" on Isis in November. But really, the video declaration was more like a recruiting strategy for one of a handful of existing campaigns within Anonymous, #OPISIS, targeting the Islamic State's Twitter presence, Gabriella Coleman, the author of \"Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous,\" told us at the time.\n\n#OPISIS, then about a year old, was mainly a crowd-sourcing operation. Specific Twitter accounts thought to be connected to the Islamic State were flagged, examined, verified, and reported to Twitter for possible suspension from the site. The November announcement of \"war\" came as some within the operation lobbied for an escalation: The new proposal was that Anonymous should dox the personal information of the people behind those accounts, an idea that caused a lot of intense internal disagreement, which largely unfolded out of sight of popular interest in the idea of a bunch of mysterious Internet vigilantes going to war with the Islamic State.\n\nAnd its worth noting that the idea of fighting terrorism - in other words, aligning Anonymous with the interests of a government, as opposed to the group's traditional antagonism to governments - is also very controversial within Anonymous, as Coleman has explained before. That larger fight caused an even more stark split within the group recently, with one group of former Anonymous participants forming a totally separate identity in order to try and position themselves better to work with government intelligence officials.\n\nAs New York magazine pointed out, Anonymous has been \"declaring war\" on things for years, starting with its well-known war on Scientology in 2008. Those wars almost never lead to the total defeat of their enemies, as promised. The melodramatic language of these declarations tends to occlude the actual purpose and result of the operations behind them -- for better or for worse - turning the popular understanding of Anonymous from what it is into a fantasy image of a bunch of elite hackers in Guy Fawkes masks, sitting behind computers doing some great hacks all day long.\n\nThere's something that sticks about that fantasy. For some, Anonymous is the ultimate vigilante - I spotted multiple, genuine expressions of relief online in the wake of the \"war\" on Trump headlines this Monday from those who believe someone needs to do something about the current GOP front-runner. For others, Anonymous has been a possibility to fear.\n\nBut that latter reputation might be fading: Many of the hyped-up wars launched in the name of Anonymous in recent memory have been chaotic, underwhelming, or disastrous.\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Washington Post\n\n",

            "text": "Articles about Anonymous \"declaring war\" on things are starting to become the John Oliver recaps of writing about Anonymous: It's a catchy headline; it's not, strictly speaking, factually wrong; and it often touches on issues currently in the news. So when a video emerges showing Anonymous declaring \"total war\" on Donald Trump , as one did earlier this month, people pay attention.\n\nJust as they did the last time Anonymous declared war on Trump. Or when Anonymous declared war on Isis, or the other time Anonymous declared war on Isis. Or when it declared war on the KKK. Or any of the many other war declarations in the years-long history of the hacking collective. But what the actual effect of an Anonymous \"war\" is - or, for that matter, what declaring war means in this context - is less discussed.\n\nIn the case of the most recent \"war\" against Trump, the declaration promises a couple of things: first, that the people behind this particular operation will try to take down several websites connected to the Trump in retaliation for his \"hateful\" campaign for president; second, that it will take place on April 1. And third, that if enough people participate, somehow all of this will \"dismantle\" the campaign of a man who has thrived on moments that would have politically destroyed anyone else, and \"sabotage\" his brand.\n\n(For the record, Trump seems to have survived Anonymous's successful Distributed Denial of Service attack against the Trump Towers' website in December.)\n\nIt's not that Trump doesn't make sense as an antagonist for Anonymous, the vigilante collective of activists and hackers: The candidate has floated a plan to \"close up\" parts of the Internet in order to stop terrorism; a voicemail account purported to be his was recently accessed and leaked; his position on the First Amendment appears to be, well, selective. The question is whether the DoS onslaught can achieve what is being promised -- a question causing internal disagreement among Anonymous right now.\n\nA different Anonymous-associated YouTube account released a video to \"terminate\" the anti-Trump operation on Wednesday arguing that the April 1 DoS pledge is \"nothing more than an empty message,\" urging Anonymous supporters to instead focus on changing \"the entire system.\"\n\nStill others worried inevitable ineffectiveness of the new Trump operation - given what it's promising to do - will only make Anonymous look bad.\n\nWhen Anonymous said it was going to war with Trump in that month over his advocating for a total ban on Muslims entering America, we argued that the war was largely a symptom of an \"identity crisis\" within Anonymous. The truth is, Anonymous is not, and has never been, a monolith. It was never intended to be. Instead, it's more of a gathering point of people - some old timers, some new; some dedicated, some just visiting - who work together on different, distinct operations. Sometimes, multiple operations have very similar goals and targets, but disagree strongly on the best approach to accomplish what they want. One great example of that in action? The various Anonymous and Anonymous-connected operations targeting the online influence of the Islamic State.\n\nAnonymous famously \"declared war\" on Isis in November. But really, the video declaration was more like a recruiting strategy for one of a handful of existing campaigns within Anonymous, #OPISIS, targeting the Islamic State's Twitter presence, Gabriella Coleman, the author of \"Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of Anonymous,\" told us at the time.\n\n#OPISIS, then about a year old, was mainly a crowd-sourcing operation. Specific Twitter accounts thought to be connected to the Islamic State were flagged, examined, verified, and reported to Twitter for possible suspension from the site. The November announcement of \"war\" came as some within the operation lobbied for an escalation: The new proposal was that Anonymous should dox the personal information of the people behind those accounts, an idea that caused a lot of intense internal disagreement, which largely unfolded out of sight of popular interest in the idea of a bunch of mysterious Internet vigilantes going to war with the Islamic State.\n\nAnd its worth noting that the idea of fighting terrorism - in other words, aligning Anonymous with the interests of a government, as opposed to the group's traditional antagonism to governments - is also very controversial within Anonymous, as Coleman has explained before. That larger fight caused an even more stark split within the group recently, with one group of former Anonymous participants forming a totally separate identity in order to try and position themselves better to work with government intelligence officials.\n\nAs New York magazine pointed out, Anonymous has been \"declaring war\" on things for years, starting with its well-known war on Scientology in 2008. Those wars almost never lead to the total defeat of their enemies, as promised. The melodramatic language of these declarations tends to occlude the actual purpose and result of the operations behind them -- for better or for worse - turning the popular understanding of Anonymous from what it is into a fantasy image of a bunch of elite hackers in Guy Fawkes masks, sitting behind computers doing some great hacks all day long.\n\nThere's something that sticks about that fantasy. For some, Anonymous is the ultimate vigilante - I spotted multiple, genuine expressions of relief online in the wake of the \"war\" on Trump headlines this Monday from those who believe someone needs to do something about the current GOP front-runner. For others, Anonymous has been a possibility to fear.\n\nBut that latter reputation might be fading: Many of the hyped-up wars launched in the name of Anonymous in recent memory have been chaotic, underwhelming, or disastrous.\n\n\u00a9 2016 The Washington Post\n\n",

        "text": "Why the Fed Has Declared War on Your Money\n\nAlexander Hamilton was America\u2019s first Secretary of Treasury under President George Washington. When he first entered office in 1789, America was an agricultural nation of just 4 million still broke from its financially costly victory over the British Empire in the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe states had accumulated relatively massive debts to finance that war, which mostly remained unpaid. The United States did not even have a national currency, with Spanish coins still in wide circulation and use. Steve Forbes explains in his recently published definitive work, Money: How the Destruction of the Dollar Threatens the Global Economy and What We Can Do About It, \u201cAmerica\u2019s finances were in a state of disarray after the wild inflation resulting from massive money printing during the American Revolution.\u201d As a result, \u201cHamilton faced the challenge of restoring the economy of the young republic that had been devastated by the Revolutionary War\u2026.\u201d\n\nWhen money serves as a stable measure of value, it most clearly expresses the value of everything in terms of everything else.\n\nHamilton boosted America\u2019s economy first by advancing legislation for the federal government to assume and pay off the debts of the states, establishing the foundation for America\u2019s historic creditworthiness. That was recognized by America\u2019s AAA credit rating for over 200 years, until 2011 when the relentless spending of the Obama Democrats led to the first credit downgrade of the nation in history.\n\nBut even more importantly for the nation\u2019s long term economic growth and prosperity, Hamilton promoted The Coinage Act of 1792, which established the first U.S. Mint, and fixed the value of the dollar at $19.39 per ounce. That was devalued slightly in 1834 to $20.67, which prevailed for 100 years, until President Roosevelt adopted the only major U.S. devaluation in history during the Depression, to $35 an ounce. That prevailed until President Nixon took America off the gold standard in 1971.\n\nForbes explained the results: \u201cOvernight the economy sprang to life. Capital poured in from the Dutch and also America\u2019s former enemies, the British. Barely a century after Hamilton\u2019s reforms, the United States was the premier industrial power in the world, surpassing even Great Britain.\u201d He added, \u201cHamilton\u2019s system of banking and stable money quickly attracted and generated capital. It turned the American economy into the leading industrial power in the world.\u201d\n\nForbes further explains that while America was under the gold standard, the economy boomed at an astounding 4% real rate of economic growth. At that rate, our economy, incomes and standard of living would double every 17 years. That was the foundation of the American dream and our historic, geometric explosion into the world\u2019s leading \u201chyperpower.\u201d\n\nForbes adds that in the U.S., \u201cBetween 1870 and 1914, real wages more than doubled even though the country had millions of immigrants [greatly expanding the supply of labor]. Agricultural output tripled. Industrial production\u2026 surged a jaw-dropping 682%.\u201d\n\nCampaign poster showing William McKinley holding U.S. flag and standing on gold coin \u201csound money\u201d, held up by group of men, in front of ships \u201ccommerce\u201d and factories \u201ccivilization\u201d. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nThe question is why did Hamilton understand economics so much better than the Ivy League poobahs of today, like Paul Krugman, who are more interested in promoting the socially hip stagnation of socialist equality than the dynamic economic growth of capitalism.\n\nIf only Colonel Hamilton was alive today, he would be more worthy of the Nobel prize in economics than at least half of those prize winners living today.\n\nGreat Britain experienced quite similar results under the gold standard. In 1696, the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke was joined by the path-breaking scientist and physicist Isaac Newton in arguing against devaluation in the process of Britain replacing or \u201crecoining\u201d its debased currency with new, unshaved, fully restored coins.\n\nBy 1717, Newton was Master of the Royal Mint, and he fixed the British pound to the value in gold of 3.89 pounds an ounce. That exact same historic value remained the same for more than 200 years, until 1931.\n\nForbes notes, \u201cWhen it tied the pound to gold, Britain was a second-tier nation. Soon all of that would change.\u201d A century later, \u201cBy the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Great Britain emerged indisputably as the world\u2019s major power and global center of innovation.\u201d\n\nFixing a nation\u2019s currency to gold assures that the currency maintains a stable long term value, without inflation, or deflation. That enables a nation\u2019s money to serve as a measure of value, like a ruler measures inches, or a clock measures time. Such a stable measure of value, in turn, means money can best perform its most essential function in facilitating transactions.\n\n\u201cAfter the 1970s, world economic growth has been a full percentage point lower; inflation 1.5% higher.\u201d\n\nWhen money serves as a stable measure of value, it most clearly expresses the value of everything in terms of everything else.\n\nThat best enables producers to determine whether their production is adding or wasting value as compared to the value of the inputs to that production. Or whether they should be producing something else instead that might create greater value. That information is essential for an economy to maximize output and economic growth over time.\n\nWhen a farmer trades his crop for such stable money, he immediately knows what that crop is worth. And he knows that he can keep that value of his production in the currency because it will hold its value over time, until he is ready to buy something with it.\n\nThat stability of the reward for production undisturbed by monetary fluctuations adds further to the incentive for such production.\n\nSimilarly, with a stable value for money, investors know the money they will receive back from their investment will be worth the same as the money they put in it, undepreciated by inflation. That encourages greater savings, investment and capital formation from within the country. And it encourages investment and capital to flow into the country from abroad. This maximizes overall investment, production and economic growth.\n\nOn August 15, 1971, President Nixon took America, and the world, off the gold standard completely, leaving a world of unanchored fiat currencies, by terminating the postwar Bretton Woods monetary regime.\n\nNixon and his advisors mistakenly believed that this would help the economy by promoting American exports, which Forbes recognizes as 18th century mercantilist thinking.\n\nBut it was a decisive turn for the worse for the American economy, and the entire global economy. Since that time, real annual U.S. economic growth has averaged 3%, down 25% from the prior gold standard long term trend. Forbes explains,\n\n\u201cIf America had grown for all of its history at the lower post-Bretton Woods rate, its economy [today] would be about one quarter of the size of China\u2019s. The United States would have ended up much smaller, less affluent, and less powerful.\u201d\n\nMoreover, \u201cSince 1971, the dollar\u2019s purchasing power has declined by more than 80%,\u201d with about a third of that (26%) since 2000. Real incomes have been stagnant, or even declined. \u201c[A] man in his thirties or forties who earned $54,163 in 1972 today earns around $45,224 in inflation adjusted dollars \u2014 a 17% cut in pay.\u201d\n\nUnemployment has been significantly higher on average. Globally, \u201cAfter the 1970s, world economic growth has been a full percentage point lower; inflation 1.5% higher.\u201d\n\nForbes observes, \u201cThe correlation between unstable money and an unstable global economy would seem obvious.\u201d Indeed, the termination of any link between the dollar and gold immediately inaugurated worsening boom and bust cycles of inflation and recession in the 1970s, with inflation soaring into double digits for several years. Inflation peaked at 25% over just two years in 1979 and 1980.\n\nIt took the worst recession since the Great Depression in 1981-1982 to tame that inflation, with double digit interest rates for years, and unemployment peaking at 10.8%. The Reagan/Volcker/Greenspan strong dollar monetary policies effectively restored a discretionary link to gold, with gold stabilizing around $300 to $350 for 20 years. That kept close control over inflation.\n\nBut this discretionary standard broke down as 2000 approached. The Fed loosened money and reduced interest rates over the Y2K scare, contributing to the tech stock bubble. Much worse, the Bush Administration supported a weak dollar monetary policy again on the mercantilist/Keynesian confusion that would help the economy by promoting exports.\n\nThat included more loose money and 2\u00bd years of negative real interest rates which served to pump up the housing bubble and lead, along with Clinton\u2019s wild overregulation (in the name of affordable housing), to the 2008 financial crisis and recession.\n\nMore tomorrow\u2026\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter Ferrara\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nEd. note: The table\u2019s been set\u2026 Now you know the history behind the gold standard and how far the U.S. has strayed from it. It\u2019s time to stop looking and lamenting about the past, and find some answers for the future. Tomorrow, Peter will look at how the country can restore the gold standard and get the economy back on track.

            "text": "Why the Fed Has Declared War on Your Money\n\nAlexander Hamilton was America\u2019s first Secretary of Treasury under President George Washington. When he first entered office in 1789, America was an agricultural nation of just 4 million still broke from its financially costly victory over the British Empire in the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe states had accumulated relatively massive debts to finance that war, which mostly remained unpaid. The United States did not even have a national currency, with Spanish coins still in wide circulation and use. Steve Forbes explains in his recently published definitive work, Money: How the Destruction of the Dollar Threatens the Global Economy and What We Can Do About It, \u201cAmerica\u2019s finances were in a state of disarray after the wild inflation resulting from massive money printing during the American Revolution.\u201d As a result, \u201cHamilton faced the challenge of restoring the economy of the young republic that had been devastated by the Revolutionary War\u2026.\u201d\n\nWhen money serves as a stable measure of value, it most clearly expresses the value of everything in terms of everything else.\n\nHamilton boosted America\u2019s economy first by advancing legislation for the federal government to assume and pay off the debts of the states, establishing the foundation for America\u2019s historic creditworthiness. That was recognized by America\u2019s AAA credit rating for over 200 years, until 2011 when the relentless spending of the Obama Democrats led to the first credit downgrade of the nation in history.\n\nBut even more importantly for the nation\u2019s long term economic growth and prosperity, Hamilton promoted The Coinage Act of 1792, which established the first U.S. Mint, and fixed the value of the dollar at $19.39 per ounce. That was devalued slightly in 1834 to $20.67, which prevailed for 100 years, until President Roosevelt adopted the only major U.S. devaluation in history during the Depression, to $35 an ounce. That prevailed until President Nixon took America off the gold standard in 1971.\n\nForbes explained the results: \u201cOvernight the economy sprang to life. Capital poured in from the Dutch and also America\u2019s former enemies, the British. Barely a century after Hamilton\u2019s reforms, the United States was the premier industrial power in the world, surpassing even Great Britain.\u201d He added, \u201cHamilton\u2019s system of banking and stable money quickly attracted and generated capital. It turned the American economy into the leading industrial power in the world.\u201d\n\nForbes further explains that while America was under the gold standard, the economy boomed at an astounding 4% real rate of economic growth. At that rate, our economy, incomes and standard of living would double every 17 years. That was the foundation of the American dream and our historic, geometric explosion into the world\u2019s leading \u201chyperpower.\u201d\n\nForbes adds that in the U.S., \u201cBetween 1870 and 1914, real wages more than doubled even though the country had millions of immigrants [greatly expanding the supply of labor]. Agricultural output tripled. Industrial production\u2026 surged a jaw-dropping 682%.\u201d\n\nCampaign poster showing William McKinley holding U.S. flag and standing on gold coin \u201csound money\u201d, held up by group of men, in front of ships \u201ccommerce\u201d and factories \u201ccivilization\u201d. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\nThe question is why did Hamilton understand economics so much better than the Ivy League poobahs of today, like Paul Krugman, who are more interested in promoting the socially hip stagnation of socialist equality than the dynamic economic growth of capitalism.\n\nIf only Colonel Hamilton was alive today, he would be more worthy of the Nobel prize in economics than at least half of those prize winners living today.\n\nGreat Britain experienced quite similar results under the gold standard. In 1696, the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke was joined by the path-breaking scientist and physicist Isaac Newton in arguing against devaluation in the process of Britain replacing or \u201crecoining\u201d its debased currency with new, unshaved, fully restored coins.\n\nBy 1717, Newton was Master of the Royal Mint, and he fixed the British pound to the value in gold of 3.89 pounds an ounce. That exact same historic value remained the same for more than 200 years, until 1931.\n\nForbes notes, \u201cWhen it tied the pound to gold, Britain was a second-tier nation. Soon all of that would change.\u201d A century later, \u201cBy the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Great Britain emerged indisputably as the world\u2019s major power and global center of innovation.\u201d\n\nFixing a nation\u2019s currency to gold assures that the currency maintains a stable long term value, without inflation, or deflation. That enables a nation\u2019s money to serve as a measure of value, like a ruler measures inches, or a clock measures time. Such a stable measure of value, in turn, means money can best perform its most essential function in facilitating transactions.\n\n\u201cAfter the 1970s, world economic growth has been a full percentage point lower; inflation 1.5% higher.\u201d\n\nWhen money serves as a stable measure of value, it most clearly expresses the value of everything in terms of everything else.\n\nThat best enables producers to determine whether their production is adding or wasting value as compared to the value of the inputs to that production. Or whether they should be producing something else instead that might create greater value. That information is essential for an economy to maximize output and economic growth over time.\n\nWhen a farmer trades his crop for such stable money, he immediately knows what that crop is worth. And he knows that he can keep that value of his production in the currency because it will hold its value over time, until he is ready to buy something with it.\n\nThat stability of the reward for production undisturbed by monetary fluctuations adds further to the incentive for such production.\n\nSimilarly, with a stable value for money, investors know the money they will receive back from their investment will be worth the same as the money they put in it, undepreciated by inflation. That encourages greater savings, investment and capital formation from within the country. And it encourages investment and capital to flow into the country from abroad. This maximizes overall investment, production and economic growth.\n\nOn August 15, 1971, President Nixon took America, and the world, off the gold standard completely, leaving a world of unanchored fiat currencies, by terminating the postwar Bretton Woods monetary regime.\n\nNixon and his advisors mistakenly believed that this would help the economy by promoting American exports, which Forbes recognizes as 18th century mercantilist thinking.\n\nBut it was a decisive turn for the worse for the American economy, and the entire global economy. Since that time, real annual U.S. economic growth has averaged 3%, down 25% from the prior gold standard long term trend. Forbes explains,\n\n\u201cIf America had grown for all of its history at the lower post-Bretton Woods rate, its economy [today] would be about one quarter of the size of China\u2019s. The United States would have ended up much smaller, less affluent, and less powerful.\u201d\n\nMoreover, \u201cSince 1971, the dollar\u2019s purchasing power has declined by more than 80%,\u201d with about a third of that (26%) since 2000. Real incomes have been stagnant, or even declined. \u201c[A] man in his thirties or forties who earned $54,163 in 1972 today earns around $45,224 in inflation adjusted dollars \u2014 a 17% cut in pay.\u201d\n\nUnemployment has been significantly higher on average. Globally, \u201cAfter the 1970s, world economic growth has been a full percentage point lower; inflation 1.5% higher.\u201d\n\nForbes observes, \u201cThe correlation between unstable money and an unstable global economy would seem obvious.\u201d Indeed, the termination of any link between the dollar and gold immediately inaugurated worsening boom and bust cycles of inflation and recession in the 1970s, with inflation soaring into double digits for several years. Inflation peaked at 25% over just two years in 1979 and 1980.\n\nIt took the worst recession since the Great Depression in 1981-1982 to tame that inflation, with double digit interest rates for years, and unemployment peaking at 10.8%. The Reagan/Volcker/Greenspan strong dollar monetary policies effectively restored a discretionary link to gold, with gold stabilizing around $300 to $350 for 20 years. That kept close control over inflation.\n\nBut this discretionary standard broke down as 2000 approached. The Fed loosened money and reduced interest rates over the Y2K scare, contributing to the tech stock bubble. Much worse, the Bush Administration supported a weak dollar monetary policy again on the mercantilist/Keynesian confusion that would help the economy by promoting exports.\n\nThat included more loose money and 2\u00bd years of negative real interest rates which served to pump up the housing bubble and lead, along with Clinton\u2019s wild overregulation (in the name of affordable housing), to the 2008 financial crisis and recession.\n\nMore tomorrow\u2026\n\nRegards,\n\nPeter Ferrara\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nEd. note: The table\u2019s been set\u2026 Now you know the history behind the gold standard and how far the U.S. has strayed from it. It\u2019s time to stop looking and lamenting about the past, and find some answers for the future.

No additional funds have been allocated for salaries.\n\nThere would be no pay hikes for Members of Parliament, provincial legislatures or the executives of public entities either, he added.\n\nREAD: Striking PSA workers taken to Labour Court\n\n\"Minister Tito Mboweni announced during his speech that the first step in this process will be to 'allow older public servants who want to do so, to retire early and gracefully'...\n\n\"The Minister also announced that these actions will, in time, be complemented by limits on overtime, bonus payments and pay progression. The Minister further referred to 'unjustified staffing' at diplomatic missions that should be reviewed urgently,\" the PSA said.\n\n\"From these statements, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Public Service have clearly declared war on public servants. Whilst plans for early retirements were previously denied publicly, it is clear that the employer cannot be trusted.\"\n\nThe minister \"failed dismally to acknowledge the real reasons for the country's economic crisis\", the statement added, saying there had been no arrests or efforts to \"recoup money from his comrades who have been implicated in corruption\".\n\n\"Instead, public servants must \u2018gracefully\u2019 pay the price for this by sacrificing on agreed terms and conditions of employment,\u201d said PSA General Manager, Ivan Fredericks.",

No additional funds have been allocated for salaries.\n\nThere would be no pay hikes for Members of Parliament, provincial legislatures or the executives of public entities either, he added.\n\nREAD: Striking PSA workers taken to Labour Court\n\n\"Minister Tito Mboweni announced during his speech that the first step in this process will be to 'allow older public servants who want to do so, to retire early and gracefully'...\n\n\"The Minister also announced that these actions will, in time, be complemented by limits on overtime, bonus payments and pay progression. The Minister further referred to 'unjustified staffing' at diplomatic missions that should be reviewed urgently,\" the PSA said.\n\n\"From these statements, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Public Service have clearly declared war on public servants. Whilst plans for early retirements were previously denied publicly, it is clear that the employer cannot be trusted.\"\n\nThe minister \"failed dismally to acknowledge the real reasons for the country's economic crisis\", the statement added, saying there had been no arrests or efforts to \"recoup money from his comrades who have been implicated in corruption\".\n\n\"Instead, public servants must \u2018gracefully\u2019 pay the price for this by sacrificing on agreed terms and conditions of employment,\u201d said PSA General Manager, Ivan Fredericks.",
