        "text": "Trump's North Korea diplomacy looks troubled. It may not mean war\n\nPresident Donald Trump's attempt to make a \"great deal\" with North Korea over its nuclear program appears increasingly in peril as Kim Jong Un has ordered new missile tests and directed his country's military \"to cope with any emergency.\"\n\n\"Nobody's happy,\" Trump said Thursday after North Korea launched short-range missiles for the second time in less than a week. On Friday, Kim told his forces to be on high alert after the U.S. seized a large cargo ship that was attempting to smuggle coal out of North Korea in violation of United Nations Security Council sanctions.\n\n\"(Kim) stressed the need to further increase the capability of the defense units in the forefront area and on the western front to carry out combat tasks and keep full combat posture,\" the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), a state media outlet that rarely quotes Pyongyang's leader directly, reported. KCNA said Kim \"set forth important tasks for further increasing the strike ability\" of North Korea's weapon systems.\n\nDiplomacy?: North Korea launches second projectile in less than a week\n\nAnalysts said the implications for Trump's diplomatic efforts at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula were not entirely clear, and that while North Korea's escalating rhetoric and military preparedness did not signal war, it showed how far apart the two nations were after two historic summits between Trump and North Korea's leader.\n\n\"These new developments show that neither country is able to sustain any kind of negotiation beyond the summits,\" said Waheguru Pal Singh, a defense and foreign policy expert at New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation, who has also consulted for the United Nations on international peace and security issues.\n\n\"For me, the key marker will be if the U.S. resumes joint military exercises with South Korea, and how the North reacts,\" he said, referring to longstanding annual large-scale Washington-Seoul military drills Trump ended in March to reduce tensions.\n\nAbout 28,000 U.S. troops plus thousands more family members and Department of Defense employees are stationed in South Korea, and their presence, and the joint military exercises, have for years been a source of North Korean anger.\n\nThe projectiles North Korea launched Saturday, and then Thursday, were the first since Pyongyang paused missile launches in late 2017. All splash-landed in the Pacific.\n\nTrump has refused to yield to North Korean demands to lift economic sanctions.\n\nSanctions no-no:U.S. seizes North Korea cargo ship linked to exporting tons of coal\n\nSouth Korea and U.S. intelligence analysts are still examining the missiles, but Michael Elleman, a missile defense expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank with offices in London and Washington, said they resemble the Russian-designed Iskander, which has a range of about 200 miles and can fit a warhead.\n\n\"Iskander can exploit gaps in South Korean and American missile-defense coverage,\" Elleman wrote in a blog post on 38 North, a Koreas-focused website.\n\nThere was further evidence that North Korea may be ramping up its military capabilities even as the Trump administration has insisted the president has maintained a good relationship with Kim despite summits in Singapore and Vietnam that ended with no tangible denuclearization steps for Pyongyang.\n\nOn Thursday night, Beyond Parallel, a program affiliated with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a global affairs think tank, published new satellite images that appeared to show that North Korea has been secretly operating a missile base that it has never previously disclosed.\n\nIn its analysis of the images, Beyond Parallel said that, though unconfirmed, the \"Yusang-ni\" base may house intercontinental ballistic missiles with a \"first strike\" capability against targets located throughout East Asia, the Pacific and the U.S.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has previously said that any missile tests by North Korea involving long-range or intercontinental missiles would be a diplomatic red line.\n\n\"It is evident that Trump's diplomatic strategy has reached an impasse,\" said Richard Caplan, a professor of international relations at Oxford University, England. \"And trade frictions with China mean that he can't count on Beijing to rein Kim in,\" he added, referring to fraught trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.\n\nNorth Korea relies on China for aid, fuel and other imports. Beijing has acted as a buffer between Pyongyang, a close ally, and Washington. Beijing's escalating trade war with Washington may make it feel less inclined to act as a referee.\n\nTrade war: U.S., China break off latest trade talks without announcing deal\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is embroiled in another front: Iran.\n\nThe White House has increasingly appeared to risk military confrontation with Tehran following U.S. and Israeli intelligence warnings that Iran or its proxies could be planning attacks on U.S. troops and facilities in the Middle East.\n\nOn Friday, the Pentagon said it was adding a missile defense system and warship to the aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers it has already sent to the Persian Gulf to meet any Iranian threats. \"It's important that Iran understand that an attack on Americans or our interests would be met with an appropriate response,\" said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. He said the threats were credible.\n\nYet the vast majority of Iran-watchers and experts have accused the Trump administration, in particular Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, of potentially inflating the intelligence because of an almost obsessive dislike for Iran.\n\n\"Trump is treating North Korea as if it has no nuclear weapons, and Iran as if it does,\" said Singh, the defense expert at New York University, referring to what he said was the president's apparent willingness to take Kim at his word that he wants to denuclearize while ignoring repeated verifications from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog that Tehran has been complying with the 2015 nuclear accord Trump withdrew the U.S. from. \"It's a very unorthodox approach,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Download the USA TODAY app",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump will head into his second meeting with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un having reframed what would make a successful summit, lowering expectations for Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization while eager to declare a flashy victory to offset the political turmoil he faces at home.\n\nTrump was the driving force behind this week\u2019s Vietnam summit, aiming to recreate the global spectacle of his first meeting with Kim, although that initial summit yielded few concrete results and the months that followed have produced little optimism about what will be achieved in the sequel. He once warned that North Korea\u2019s arsenal posed such a threat to humanity that he may have no choice but to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d on the rogue nation, yet on Sunday declared that he was in no hurry for Pyongyang to prove it was abandoning its weapons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a rush. I don\u2019t want to rush anybody, I just don\u2019t want testing. As long as there\u2019s no testing, we\u2019re happy,\u201d Trump told a gathering of governors at the White House. Hours earlier, he ended a tweet about the summit by posing the key question that looms over their meeting in Vietnam: \u201cDenuclearization?\u201d\n\nHe did not provide an answer.\n\nThough worries abound across world capitals about what Trump might be willing to give up in the name of a win, the president was ready to write himself into the history books before he and Kim even shake hands in Hanoi.\n\n\u201cIf I were not elected president, you would have been in a war with North Korea,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cWe now have a situation where the relationships are good \u2014 where there has been no nuclear testing, no missiles, no rockets.\u201d\n\nWhatever the North Koreans have done so far, the survival of the Kim regime is always the primary concern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim inherited a nascent, incomplete nuclear program from his father, and after years of accelerated effort and fighting through crippling sanctions, he built an arsenal that demonstrates the potential capability to deliver a thermonuclear weapon to the mainland United States. That is the fundamental reason Washington now sits at the negotiating table.\n\nKim, his world standing elevated after receiving an audience with a U.S. president, has yet to show a convincing sign that he is willing to deal away an arsenal that might provide a stronger guarantee of survival than whatever security assurance the United States could provide. The North Koreans have largely eschewed staff-level talks, pushing for discussions between Trump and Kim.\n\nTrump will arrive in Hanoi on Tuesday on Air Force One while his counterpart, lacking a modern aircraft fleet, travels via armored train. Though details of the summit remain closely held, the two leaders are expected to meet at some point one-on-one, joined only by translators.\n\nThe easing of tension between the two nations, Trump and his allies believe, stems from the U.S. president\u2019s own unorthodox and unpredictable style of diplomacy. Often prizing personal rapport over long-held strategic interests, Trump has pointed to his budding relationship with the young and reclusive leader, frequently showing visitors to the Oval Office his flattering letters from Kim.\n\nTrump, who has long declared that North Korea represented the gravest foreign threat of his presidency, told reporters recently that his efforts to defang Pyongyang had moved Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize, something Abe would not confirm or deny. And, always with an eye on his media coverage, Trump had delighted in the round-the-clock phenomenon created by the first Kim summit, held last June in Singapore. He urged reluctant aides as early as last fall to begin preparations for a second meeting.\n\nThe images of the first face-to-face meeting between a U.S. president and his North Korean counterpart resonated across the globe. Four main goals emerged: establishing new relations between the nations, building a new peace on the Korean Peninsula, completing denuclearization of the peninsula and recovering U.S. POW/MIA remains from the Korean War.\n\nWhile some remains have been returned to the United States, little has been achieved on the other points. Korean and American negotiators have not settled on either the parameters of denuclearization or the timetable for the removal of both Korean weapons and American sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe key lessons of Singapore are that President Trump sees tremendous value in the imagery of diplomacy and wants to be seen as a bold leader, even if the substance of the diplomacy is far behind the pageantry,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials testified before Congress last month that it remains unlikely Kim would fully dismantle his arsenal. And many voices in the Trump administration, including national security adviser John Bolton, have expressed skepticism that North Korea would ever live up to a deal.\n\nMark Chinoy, senior fellow at U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, made clear that after generations of hostility, the convivial atmosphere of Singapore \u201ccan\u2019t be discounted.\u201d But Chinoy noted that Trump had agreed to North Korean\u2019s \u201cformulation of \u2018denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,\u2019 which Pyongyang has long made clear meant an end to the US security alliance with South Korea and an end to the US nuclear umbrella intended to defend South Korea and Japan.\u201d\n\nAfter the last summit, Trump unilaterally suspended some military drills with South Korea, alarming some in Seoul and at the Pentagon. But he was insistent this week that he would not drawdown U.S. troops from South Korea. And American officials, even as they hint at a relaxed timetable for Pyongyang to account for its full arsenal, have continued to publicly insist they would not ease punishing sanctions on North Korea until denuclearization is complete.\n\nA year ago, North Korea suspended its nuclear and long-range missile tests and said it dismantled its nuclear testing ground but those measures were not perceived as meaningful reductions. Experts believe Kim, who is enjoying warmer relations with South Korea and the easing of pressure from Russia and China, will seek a U.S. commitment for improved bilateral relations and partial sanctions relief while trying to minimize any concessions on his nuclear facilities and weapons.\n\n\u201cKim is doing pretty well as it is,\u201d said Scott Seaman of the Eurasia Group. \u201cThe threat of a U.S. military strike is essentially zero, Kim\u2019s diplomatic charm offensive has made him into a bigger player on the world stage, and he continues to whittle away at international commitment to sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe Hanoi summit comes at a politically perilous time for Trump.\n\nHis potential 2020 foes have begun unleashing their attacks. The newly elected Democratic House has begun its onslaught of investigations into the president, calling his former fixer, Michael Cohen, to appear before Congress while the president is in Vietnam. And special counsel Robert Mueller, who has investigated possible ties between Trump\u2019s campaign Russian election interference, may finalize his report within days of the president\u2019s return to the United States.\n\nTrump may be eager to change the subject and some foreign policy experts fear that could prompt the president to make a significant concession or strike an attention-grabbing deal \u2014 such as a declaration to formally end the Korean War, which has been suspended in an armistice since 1953 \u2014 without extracting much in return from Kim. North Korea\u2019s long history of human rights abuses is also unlikely to be on the agenda.\n\n\u201cClearly, the president is looking for a win,\u201d said Denmark. \u201cThe North Koreans know this and will likely expect President Trump to be looking to make an agreement with limited regard for its content.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul and Deb Riechmann, Catherine Lucey, Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Redefining success, President Donald Trump heads into his second meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un determined to tamp down expectations that he'll gain a roadmap to denuclearization. Yet he's still eager to claim an attention-grabbing victory to offset the political turmoil he faces at home.\n\nTrump laid out ultimate goals for both the U.S. and Kim in an appearance before the nation's governors Monday before boarding Air Force One to fly to Vietnam: \"We want denuclearization, and I think he'll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy.\"\n\nWorries abound across world capitals about what Trump might be willing to give up in the name of a win, but there seems less mystery about his North Korean counterpart.

        "text": "opinion\n\nTrump has entered Phase 2 of his legal defense strategy: All-out war with Congress\n\nWe are seeing Phase 2 of Donald Trump\u2019s legal strategy to defend himself against government investigations. It\u2019s called, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas,\u201d and it amounts to an all-out war with Congress.\n\nIn Phase 1, Trump knew special counsel Robert Mueller could never lay a glove on him because of the Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The Phase 1 legal strategy seemed to be produce documents and witnesses so Attorney General William Barr could announce that the White House had \"fully cooperated\" \u2014 even though the president himself refused to be interviewed, no criminal charges could be filed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could proclaim \u201ccase closed.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump faces investigation from a coequal branch of government that actually could remove him from office through impeachment, the Phase 2 strategy kicks in: Fight everything.\n\nThe Mueller investigation turned out to be a fool\u2019s errand from the start. As Barr has stated repeatedly, prosecutors make \u201cbinary\u201d decisions: Charge or don\u2019t charge. Except here\u2019s the trick: When investigating a president, given DOJ policy, the only possible decision is don\u2019t charge. In other words, heads I win, tails you lose. Cooperation is easy when you can\u2019t be charged.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMueller didn't say it so we did: Trump would face felony charges if he weren't president\n\nMnuchin defies the law by withholding Trump tax returns. Congress can't let this stand.\n\nTrump administration could leave Congress no choice but an impeachment inquiry: Lieu\n\nIn Phase 2, Trump is making no pretense of cooperating. Instead, he's characterizing congressional investigations as an effort to relitigate the Mueller investigation. The fallacy of his argument is that while Mueller believed he could not charge Trump, he deferred to Congress as the appropriate body to check the president. Facts developed by Mueller may be helpful to Congress, but these investigations are different because they could result in serious consequences for the president.\n\nAn escalating accumulation of obstruction\n\nRather than cooperating, Trump has filed lawsuits to block his accounting firm and banks from complying with subpoenas to produce his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Mueller should not testify before Congress, even though Barr has said that he has no objection. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a request from House Ways and Means Committee to produce Trump\u2019s tax returns, despite a law stating that he \u201cshall furnish\u201d returns upon request.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House prohibited former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena for documents, stating that the president might want to assert executive privilege. On Wednesday, the White House asserted executive privilege over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, including statements made to investigators during interviews, for which the privilege has arguably been waived. That same day, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration is engaged in \u201ca cumulative effect of obstruction\u201d that could lead to other contempt of Congress citations.\n\nExecutive privilege is a recognized doctrine that presidents may use to protect confidential communications, national security matters and agency deliberations. DOJ has also historically asserted executive privilege to protect ongoing investigations and individuals\u2019 privacy interests. But the parameters of executive privilege are largely undefined, and the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that the privilege is a qualified one that must yield when items are subpoenaed for criminal trial. We entrust our executive branch officials to exercise the privilege judiciously to protect legitimate interests, such as fostering candid advice from aides, and not to use it as a shield to conceal misconduct.\n\n'Accommodation' is not how Trump rolls\n\nIn the past, we have counted on norms to help us avoid showdowns between branches of government, sometimes described as a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d One of these norms is the process of accommodation, in which branches of government negotiate a resolution that allows the parties to move on without court intervention. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general, William French Smith, described accommodation in a 1981 opinion as essential to responsible exercise of government power: \u201cThe accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge, and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.\u201d\n\nEven so, we all know by now that \u201caccommodation\u201d is not how Trump rolls. He is a disrupter. He is not afraid to break the norms; in fact, he thrives on it. Norm-busting is part of his appeal to his base. He does not shrink from a good fight. He has made a career of using the legal process to bully others to get his way.\n\nAnd even if Trump ultimately loses his legal battles in Phase 2, success is not necessarily defined as prevailing in court, but in delaying any resolution until after the 2020 election. Some even suggest Trump is daring congressional Democrats to impeach him, knowing that the Republican-led Senate will never convict him, and luring his opponents into a political trap that will help him win reelection.\n\nCongress must protect Constitution, not Trump\n\nThis is no way to run a government. While Trump\u2019s strategy to stonewall might help him \u201cwin,\u201d it could do long-term damage to our country.

It\u2019s called, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas,\u201d and it amounts to an all-out war with Congress.\n\nIn Phase 1, Trump knew special counsel Robert Mueller could never lay a glove on him because of the Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The Phase 1 legal strategy seemed to be produce documents and witnesses so Attorney General William Barr could announce that the White House had \"fully cooperated\" \u2014 even though the president himself refused to be interviewed, no criminal charges could be filed, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could proclaim \u201ccase closed.\u201d\n\nNow that Trump faces investigation from a coequal branch of government that actually could remove him from office through impeachment, the Phase 2 strategy kicks in: Fight everything.\n\nThe Mueller investigation turned out to be a fool\u2019s errand from the start. As Barr has stated repeatedly, prosecutors make \u201cbinary\u201d decisions: Charge or don\u2019t charge. Except here\u2019s the trick: When investigating a president, given DOJ policy, the only possible decision is don\u2019t charge. In other words, heads I win, tails you lose. Cooperation is easy when you can\u2019t be charged.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nMueller didn't say it so we did: Trump would face felony charges if he weren't president\n\nMnuchin defies the law by withholding Trump tax returns. Congress can't let this stand.\n\nTrump administration could leave Congress no choice but an impeachment inquiry: Lieu\n\nIn Phase 2, Trump is making no pretense of cooperating. Instead, he's characterizing congressional investigations as an effort to relitigate the Mueller investigation. The fallacy of his argument is that while Mueller believed he could not charge Trump, he deferred to Congress as the appropriate body to check the president. Facts developed by Mueller may be helpful to Congress, but these investigations are different because they could result in serious consequences for the president.\n\nAn escalating accumulation of obstruction\n\nRather than cooperating, Trump has filed lawsuits to block his accounting firm and banks from complying with subpoenas to produce his financial records to the House Oversight and Reform Committee. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that Mueller should not testify before Congress, even though Barr has said that he has no objection. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a request from House Ways and Means Committee to produce Trump\u2019s tax returns, despite a law stating that he \u201cshall furnish\u201d returns upon request.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House prohibited former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena for documents, stating that the president might want to assert executive privilege. On Wednesday, the White House asserted executive privilege over the unredacted Mueller report and its underlying evidence, including statements made to investigators during interviews, for which the privilege has arguably been waived. That same day, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the administration is engaged in \u201ca cumulative effect of obstruction\u201d that could lead to other contempt of Congress citations.\n\nExecutive privilege is a recognized doctrine that presidents may use to protect confidential communications, national security matters and agency deliberations. DOJ has also historically asserted executive privilege to protect ongoing investigations and individuals\u2019 privacy interests. But the parameters of executive privilege are largely undefined, and the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that the privilege is a qualified one that must yield when items are subpoenaed for criminal trial. We entrust our executive branch officials to exercise the privilege judiciously to protect legitimate interests, such as fostering candid advice from aides, and not to use it as a shield to conceal misconduct.\n\n'Accommodation' is not how Trump rolls\n\nIn the past, we have counted on norms to help us avoid showdowns between branches of government, sometimes described as a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d One of these norms is the process of accommodation, in which branches of government negotiate a resolution that allows the parties to move on without court intervention. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first attorney general, William French Smith, described accommodation in a 1981 opinion as essential to responsible exercise of government power: \u201cThe accommodation required is not simply an exchange of concessions or a test of political strength. It is an obligation of each branch to make a principled effort to acknowledge, and if possible to meet, the legitimate needs of the other branch.\u201d\n\nEven so, we all know by now that \u201caccommodation\u201d is not how Trump rolls. He is a disrupter. He is not afraid to break the norms; in fact, he thrives on it. Norm-busting is part of his appeal to his base. He does not shrink from a good fight. He has made a career of using the legal process to bully others to get his way.\n\nAnd even if Trump ultimately loses his legal battles in Phase 2, success is not necessarily defined as prevailing in court, but in delaying any resolution until after the 2020 election. Some even suggest Trump is daring congressional Democrats to impeach him, knowing that the Republican-led Senate will never convict him, and luring his opponents into a political trap that will help him win reelection.\n\nCongress must protect Constitution, not Trump\n\nThis is no way to run a government. While Trump\u2019s strategy to stonewall might help him \u201cwin,\u201d it could do long-term damage to our country. Our constitutional system is built on checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. But the system relies on people of good faith to exercise those checks and balances.\n\nFor example, the president must not just execute the law but also take care that the laws be executed \u201cfaithfully.\u201d And members of Congress owe their allegiance not just to their party but also to their country, as Republican lawmakers demonstrated during the Watergate scandal. Their oath of office swears them to support and defend the Constitution, not the president or their party.\n\nAs Trump tests the norms of government, we need members of the executive and legislative branches to overcome tribal instincts and do what\u2019s best for our nation. For members of the executive branch, that means using executive privilege on an item-by-item basis and not for blanket protection from all inquiry.

        "publishDate": "2019-05-04 21:52:14+00:00",
        "text": "By Iqbal Jassat\n\nIf America\u2019s standing in the globe as the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d has been on shaky grounds following its disastrous wars post-9/11, US president Donald Trump has ensured that whatever little credibility it may still have enjoyed among European allies and the United Nations, is totally ruined.\n\nHis messy and bloody military adventure in Libya via the CIA-trained General Haftar, is reflective of the growing alienation with international conventions his administration is being viewed with.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to finance and equip Haftar with sophisticated weapons including fighter jets, has met with fierce resistance from the UN-recognized government. That the military attempt via a bloody coup to install Haftar has failed thus far, the ongoing bloodletting is further indication that Trump will defiantly pursue his regime-change agenda regardless of innocent lives being lost.\n\nPolicies of lose-lose have characterized Trump since his inception and if the electoral strength of his rightwing white supremacists persists, his second term may turn out to be worse. America\u2019s leadership will remain firmly stuck in the hands of neocons and Israel\u2019s equally racist colonialists.\n\nTrumpism has outstripped Machiavellism. And unlike the false sophistry of previous administrations particularly that of Clinton and Obama, Trump\u2019s buffoonery is blatantly associated with visible layers of arrogance, deceit, corruption and disdain.\n\nHis illegal intervention in Venezuela is further evidence of rampant power gone astray. It is to be expected of hoodlums, which is what Trump\u2019s gung-ho meddling in the affairs of other nations defines him as.\n\nVenezuela has been engulfed with a civil war as Trump\u2019s men put the squeeze on the military to abandon President Maduro.\n\nRightwing hawks including John Bolton have demanded that senior military officials pull the rug to allow US-backed Guaido to assume power and control of the oil-rich country. A coup is underway whether the world likes it or not, is the blunt message emanating from the White House.\n\nApart from creating civil strife in Libya and Venezuela, Trump\u2019s mafia-type operation can also be gauged by his apparent blackmailing of Ecuador.\n\nThe case of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and how Ecuador traded him for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), illustrates the danger to whistleblowers resulting from Washington\u2019s control of the IMF.\n\nYou can\u2019t get an IMF loan unless the United States (read Donald Trump) approves it \u2013 upon agreement to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy.\n\nUS military involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen, under the direct command of Trump, is another case in point. Though Congress voted in favor of a resolution to end US support, Trump vetoed it. His calculation is obviously based on the trade-offs he can and has secured with Saudi crown prince Mohamed bin Salman (MbS).\n\nNow that a new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the US-backed Saudi war of aggression on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previous assessments, its left to be seen whether Congress will vote to overturn Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nWhile it appears that American-based commentators, who by the way are a tickey-a-dozen on CNN, FOX and most media outlets, are pitted against each other in attempts to either rationalize or ridicule Trump\u2019s actions, the Donald show moves on in a blaze of fiery rhetoric and unilateral action.\n\nRecently Trump made one of his trademark boisterous remarks about Saudi Arabia, claiming he warned King Salman he would not last in power for \u201ctwo weeks\u201d without the backing of the US military.\n\nWhile it may be undiplomatic, the House of Saud knows only too well that it is true.\n\nNot only is it a confirmation of the devastating reach American imperialism has, but it also says to the world that Trump and his group of thugs do not care about respecting civilized values.\n\nIn the case of Iran, Trump has boasted that not only does he trust Netanyahu\u2019s allegations despite his own intelligence agencies disputing Israel\u2019s so-called \u201cevidence\u201d, but he is also willing to sacrifice American soldiers on behalf of Zionist ideals.\n\nSanctions against Iran coupled with threats of a full-scale war, in abject compliance with Israel\u2019s dictates, have the potential to plunge the world to levels of unprecedented chaos and instability. Consequences of it hold the promise of a horror movie, except that it will be a reality.\n\nTrump\u2019s unilateral decision to break out of Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement has not been favorably met by Europe. But Trump\u2019s recklessness knows no bounds. That he has done so to satisfy Netanyahu, with the full knowledge of turning his administration into a pariah in the eyes of European signatories is not a secret.\n\nTrump\u2019s disdain for international conventions and humanitarian laws is unfortunately not only confined to the countries and regions mentioned above. His outrageous assault on Palestinian rights confirms how repugnant and depraved Trump\u2019s administration is.\n\nTo bring Palestinians into line, and to force a Saudi-backed Bantustan leadership to accept whatever bizarre version of \u2018peace\u2019 Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner has plotted in league with Netanyahu, Trump has taken several steps aimed at intimidating the PA.\n\nThese include the cutting of $200 million in direct aid to Gaza and the West Bank and the freezing of another $300 million dollars provided annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).\n\nTo illustrate how determined Trump is to reign as America\u2019s undisputed rogue leader, look no further than his arbitrary decree to \u201cgrant\u201d Jerusalem, the Golan and now the Occupied West Bank to the region\u2019s colonial settler regime Israel. A foreign intervention which not only defies UNSC resolutions but also \u201cgifts\u201d Netanyahu what he and fellow Zionists plotted to expand Israel\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise.\n\nTrump\u2019s single-minded goal to reshape the world in his image will ultimately become his albatross. But until then, fueling wars and conflicts in pursuance of undisguised white supremacist hegemony will continue to take a toll on human lives.\n\n\u2013 Iqbal Jassat is an Executive Member of the South Africa-based Media Review Network.

            "text": "By Iqbal Jassat\n\nIf America\u2019s standing in the globe as the \u201cleader of the free world\u201d has been on shaky grounds following its disastrous wars post-9/11, US president Donald Trump has ensured that whatever little credibility it may still have enjoyed among European allies and the United Nations, is totally ruined.\n\nHis messy and bloody military adventure in Libya via the CIA-trained General Haftar, is reflective of the growing alienation with international conventions his administration is being viewed with.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to finance and equip Haftar with sophisticated weapons including fighter jets, has met with fierce resistance from the UN-recognized government. That the military attempt via a bloody coup to install Haftar has failed thus far, the ongoing bloodletting is further indication that Trump will defiantly pursue his regime-change agenda regardless of innocent lives being lost.\n\nPolicies of lose-lose have characterized Trump since his inception and if the electoral strength of his rightwing white supremacists persists, his second term may turn out to be worse. America\u2019s leadership will remain firmly stuck in the hands of neocons and Israel\u2019s equally racist colonialists.\n\nTrumpism has outstripped Machiavellism. And unlike the false sophistry of previous administrations particularly that of Clinton and Obama, Trump\u2019s buffoonery is blatantly associated with visible layers of arrogance, deceit, corruption and disdain.\n\nHis illegal intervention in Venezuela is further evidence of rampant power gone astray. It is to be expected of hoodlums, which is what Trump\u2019s gung-ho meddling in the affairs of other nations defines him as.\n\nVenezuela has been engulfed with a civil war as Trump\u2019s men put the squeeze on the military to abandon President Maduro.\n\nRightwing hawks including John Bolton have demanded that senior military officials pull the rug to allow US-backed Guaido to assume power and control of the oil-rich country. A coup is underway whether the world likes it or not, is the blunt message emanating from the White House.\n\nApart from creating civil strife in Libya and Venezuela, Trump\u2019s mafia-type operation can also be gauged by his apparent blackmailing of Ecuador.\n\nThe case of Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange and how Ecuador traded him for a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), illustrates the danger to whistleblowers resulting from Washington\u2019s control of the IMF.\n\nYou can\u2019t get an IMF loan unless the United States (read Donald Trump) approves it \u2013 upon agreement to remove Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy.\n\nUS military involvement in Saudi Arabia\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen, under the direct command of Trump, is another case in point. Though Congress voted in favor of a resolution to end US support, Trump vetoed it. His calculation is obviously based on the trade-offs he can and has secured with Saudi crown prince Mohamed bin Salman (MbS).\n\nNow that a new UN-commissioned report shows that the impact of the US-backed Saudi war of aggression on civilians, particularly children, is far worse than previous assessments, its left to be seen whether Congress will vote to overturn Trump\u2019s veto.\n\nWhile it appears that American-based commentators, who by the way are a tickey-a-dozen on CNN, FOX and most media outlets, are pitted against each other in attempts to either rationalize or ridicule Trump\u2019s actions, the Donald show moves on in a blaze of fiery rhetoric and unilateral action.\n\nRecently Trump made one of his trademark boisterous remarks about Saudi Arabia, claiming he warned King Salman he would not last in power for \u201ctwo weeks\u201d without the backing of the US military.\n\nWhile it may be undiplomatic, the House of Saud knows only too well that it is true.\n\nNot only is it a confirmation of the devastating reach American imperialism has, but it also says to the world that Trump and his group of thugs do not care about respecting civilized values.\n\nIn the case of Iran, Trump has boasted that not only does he trust Netanyahu\u2019s allegations despite his own intelligence agencies disputing Israel\u2019s so-called \u201cevidence\u201d, but he is also willing to sacrifice American soldiers on behalf of Zionist ideals.\n\nSanctions against Iran coupled with threats of a full-scale war, in abject compliance with Israel\u2019s dictates, have the potential to plunge the world to levels of unprecedented chaos and instability. Consequences of it hold the promise of a horror movie, except that it will be a reality.\n\nTrump\u2019s unilateral decision to break out of Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement has not been favorably met by Europe. But Trump\u2019s recklessness knows no bounds. That he has done so to satisfy Netanyahu, with the full knowledge of turning his administration into a pariah in the eyes of European signatories is not a secret.\n\nTrump\u2019s disdain for international conventions and humanitarian laws is unfortunately not only confined to the countries and regions mentioned above. His outrageous assault on Palestinian rights confirms how repugnant and depraved Trump\u2019s administration is.\n\nTo bring Palestinians into line, and to force a Saudi-backed Bantustan leadership to accept whatever bizarre version of \u2018peace\u2019 Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner has plotted in league with Netanyahu, Trump has taken several steps aimed at intimidating the PA.\n\nThese include the cutting of $200 million in direct aid to Gaza and the West Bank and the freezing of another $300 million dollars provided annually to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).\n\nTo illustrate how determined Trump is to reign as America\u2019s undisputed rogue leader, look no further than his arbitrary decree to \u201cgrant\u201d Jerusalem, the Golan and now the Occupied West Bank to the region\u2019s colonial settler regime Israel. A foreign intervention which not only defies UNSC resolutions but also \u201cgifts\u201d Netanyahu what he and fellow Zionists plotted to expand Israel\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise.\n\nTrump\u2019s single-minded goal to reshape the world in his image will ultimately become his albatross. But until then, fueling wars and conflicts in pursuance of undisguised white supremacist hegemony will continue to take a toll on human lives.\n\n\u2013 Iqbal Jassat is an Executive Member of the South Africa-based Media Review Network.

        "text": "At the first official event of his presidential campaign last month at the Local 249's Teamsters banquet union hall in Pittsburgh, former Vice President Joe Biden, long known as \"middle-class Joe,\" made a firm declaration: \"I make no apologies. I am a union man. Period.\"\n\nBefore an animated crowd in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of one of the nation\u2019s most famous labor strikes, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made her presidential bid official.\n\nKeith Srakocic/AP\n\n\"The story of Lawrence is a story about how real change happens in America,\" Warren told the crowd on a frigid morning in early February. \"It\u2019s a story about power \u2014 our power \u2014 when we fight together.\"\n\nAnd now, roughly four and a half months into the Democratic presidential primary, the campaign staffs of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro have become the first in history to unionize.\n\nThese symbolic and tangible nods to working-class America and overtures to the progressive wings of the party are part of a strategy to court the union vote, which will be crucial to clinching the Democratic nomination.\n\nEven with an established name like Biden, who secured the first major labor union endorsement of the 2020 contest from the International Association of Firefighters the morning of his Pittsburgh rally, in the race and Sanders\u2019 emphasis on the plight of America\u2019s middle class, a field of now over 20 candidates ensures that the fight for support from organized labor will be far more competitive this time around.\n\n\"With this many candidates running, working people can afford to be selective with our vote,\u201d John Weber, press secretary for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the nation\u2019s largest federation of unions in the United States, told ABC News. \"We're looking for a candidate who understands that the single best way to make our economy fairer is by making it easier to join a union. If your first priority isn't fighting for working families, we're not interested.\"\n\nHowever, the 2020 contenders are already facing hurdles striking a chord within the union community. Earlier this week, Biden was met with a protest outside a Los Angeles fundraiser by members of the National Union of Healthcare workers who showed skepticism about his support for unions.\n\n\"All I can say is this: Joe said \"I\u2019m a union man,\" Eric Pierce, a clinician at Kaiser Permanente, told ABC News. \"Mr. Vice President I\u2019m a union man too but you know as a Union man that unions are for the communities they work in and work for\u2014they\u2019re not just for the membership. They\u2019re for the community. So I ask Mr. Vice President to join us, help us advocate\u2026\"\n\nThis cycle, Democrats are competing for the union vote in a new reality \u2013 one that is shaped by a dynamic that tips in favor of union membership after 2016.\n\nIn the early lead up to the 2016 presidential election, the Machinists Union, a labor organization of nearly 600,000 members, endorsed Hillary Clinton in August 2015 \u2013 five months before the Iowa caucuses \u2013 through a unanimous vote by union leaders and an internal survey of IAM members. But according to the group\u2019s current leader, many members within the union dissented, supporting Sanders in his insurgent, grassroots campaign for the Democratic nomination instead.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP, FILE\n\nA few months after IAM publicly announced its support for Clinton, newly-minted international president Bob Martinez, now sitting at the helm of the union, attended a staff conference in San Diego in January 2016, where a local president pressed him on the endorsement process, urging for a more member-driven approach during a Q&A session.\n\n\"It was apparent to me from the beginning that, you know, this is something that we should have been doing for a long time, the membership deserves the right to voice their opinion in the endorsement process,\" Martinez told ABC News in an interview Thursday.\n\n\"We set up a process for them to do just that,\" he added.\n\nIn a stark contrast from the closed-door meetings typical of Washington, the new process, unveiled this week at a legislative conference in Washington, downsizes the influence of the union\u2019s top brass and shifts it to the organization\u2019s members, who will be able to vote online for their candidate of choice.\n\nMartinez said the changes seek to push the candidates to engage with the union\u2019s rank and file through their state councils across the country, which represent the union\u2019s political arm in each state that will ultimately vote on an endorsement. It also signals efforts to prioritize transparency and the issues most important to members, including pension reform, health care, trade, and access to unions.\n\n\"I have candidates calling me now personally, and what I'm telling them is, 'Hey, you know, you're going to have to go to the membership, you're going to have to go to our local lodges, you're going to have to go to our district meetings, you're going to have to go to our conferences, and other places where IAM members are to let them hear you. You need to, you know, ascertain their vote, face to face with them,'\" Martinez said.\n\n\"I think that it's resonating well with some of the candidates, who are inquiring as to where our locations of our locals and our districts are, where they can go out and meet with them, set up meetings in different states,\" he continued.\n\nThe change also comes as the Democratic Party looks to stem the erosion of support from union households that it saw in 2016.\n\nWhile union households backed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 by 20 and 18 points respectively, Hillary Clinton only won them by 9 points over Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nA significant improvement in 2020 could be a key way Democrats win back the White House in 2020, but first candidates have to make their pitch the unions themselves.\n\nSeeking to win over a ballroom filled with IAM members this week, seven of the Democratic candidates touted similar pro-labor riffs and blended personal and policy appeals in back-to-back pitches, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Maryland Congressman John Delaney, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton, Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, and Sanders.\n\nAaron Josefczyk/Reuters, FILE\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to sit around and beg some president or beg some leader,\" Ryan said to the predominantly blue-collar audience as his cadence during the emotionally rousing speech picked up. \"You want me to wait. I ain\u2019t waiting. I ain\u2019t waiting no more\u2026You know I\u2019m just a kid from steel country, old high school quarterback from Northeast Ohio, Friday Night Lights. You know what \u2014 it\u2019s about time we have a quarterback in the White House in the United States of America.\"\n\n\"I stand before you today as a proud, proud, proud, child of unions,\" Klobuchar, who was raised in a union household, asserted before the group. \"I\u2019ve got grit, and you need grit to take this guy on and you need grit to run this country, and you need grit to win this office.\"\n\n\"If I'm elected president, my administration will impose an immediate moratorium on any future pension cuts to multi-employer pension plans,\" Sanders said at the event, announcing a pledge to block cuts to promised retirement benefits if he is vaulted to the White House. \"A promise made must be a promise kept.\"\n\nMartinez said IAM aims to \"pull the trigger\" on an endorsement after Super Tuesday when the massive Democratic field will likely be winnowed down.\n\nIn the meantime, Martinez said he hopes to hear more from Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"Our membership wants to hear from all the candidates,\" Martinez said, before adding, \"I think that if they want the Machinists Union endorsement, any of them that haven't spoken to the Machinists Union membership, I think they need to get on board and come out nad speak to our membership.\"\n\nABC News' Molly Nagle contributed to this report.",

You need to, you know, ascertain their vote, face to face with them,'\" Martinez said.\n\n\"I think that it's resonating well with some of the candidates, who are inquiring as to where our locations of our locals and our districts are, where they can go out and meet with them, set up meetings in different states,\" he continued.\n\nThe change also comes as the Democratic Party looks to stem the erosion of support from union households that it saw in 2016.\n\nWhile union households backed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 by 20 and 18 points respectively, Hillary Clinton only won them by 9 points over Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nA significant improvement in 2020 could be a key way Democrats win back the White House in 2020, but first candidates have to make their pitch the unions themselves.\n\nSeeking to win over a ballroom filled with IAM members this week, seven of the Democratic candidates touted similar pro-labor riffs and blended personal and policy appeals in back-to-back pitches, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Maryland Congressman John Delaney, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton, Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, and Sanders.\n\nAaron Josefczyk/Reuters, FILE\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to sit around and beg some president or beg some leader,\" Ryan said to the predominantly blue-collar audience as his cadence during the emotionally rousing speech picked up. \"You want me to wait. I ain\u2019t waiting. I ain\u2019t waiting no more\u2026You know I\u2019m just a kid from steel country, old high school quarterback from Northeast Ohio, Friday Night Lights. You know what \u2014 it\u2019s about time we have a quarterback in the White House in the United States of America.\"\n\n\"I stand before you today as a proud, proud, proud, child of unions,\" Klobuchar, who was raised in a union household, asserted before the group. \"I\u2019ve got grit, and you need grit to take this guy on and you need grit to run this country, and you need grit to win this office.\"\n\n\"If I'm elected president, my administration will impose an immediate moratorium on any future pension cuts to multi-employer pension plans,\" Sanders said at the event, announcing a pledge to block cuts to promised retirement benefits if he is vaulted to the White House. \"A promise made must be a promise kept.\"\n\nMartinez said IAM aims to \"pull the trigger\" on an endorsement after Super Tuesday when the massive Democratic field will likely be winnowed down.\n\nIn the meantime, Martinez said he hopes to hear more from Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\"Our membership wants to hear from all the candidates,\" Martinez said, before adding, \"I think that if they want the Machinists Union endorsement, any of them that haven't spoken to the Machinists Union membership, I think they need to get on board and come out nad speak to our membership.\"\n\nABC News' Molly Nagle contributed to this report.",

        "text": "CNN Video\n\nThe 2020 Democratic contenders showed up in force at a labor forum on Saturday to outline their plans for raising wages and court the all-important constituency of labor as they seek foot soldiers for their campaigns.\n\nIt is a constituency that was once strongly behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but in this crowded field of 2020 candidates, none of them are willing to cede that ground.\n\nThey came to this early caucus state Saturday armed with plans to fight for a $15 minimum wage, expand Medicare-for-All, unravel right-to-work laws, and to pressure corporate titans to pay more to Americans who are trying to patch together a living wage with two, and sometimes three, jobs.\n\nAmong the forum's questioners was Jennifer Berry, a McDonald's employee in Milwaukee who told California Sen. Kamala Harris on Saturday that she makes $9.90 an hour. With a two-week paycheck of $514, she said she must also rely on government assistance, including Medicaid, food share benefits and Wisconsin's housing program.\n\n\"In our America, nobody should have to work more than one job, so let's talk about our values,\" Harris said at the forum held by Service Employees International Union and the Center for American Progress Action Fund. \"You can't go around talking about the golden arches as the symbol of the best of American when you are not conducting yourself in the best way in terms of supporting the working people of America.\"\n\nHarris added that Americans \"deserve to have a wage that allows them to keep up with the cost of living.\"\n\n\"We can talk about a minimum wage \u2014 of course, we need to fight for $15 \u2014 but really that's a minimum, that's a minimum standard of living,\" she said.\n\nIn her closing remarks about America being at an inflection point, she told the forum that \"people are woke ... the challenge will be to harness that energy and to organize\" to get people to the polls.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren spoke jokingly about billionaires not supporting her candidacy.\n\n\"Are you telling me that the billionaires are not in favor of my being President of the United States?\" the Massachusetts Democrat said. \"Damn, you just upset every plan I had -- I'm shocked. Gosh, I guess I might have to do it by getting out there, getting people organized, fighting for working people and persisting. We can win. We dream big, we fight hard. That's how we win, it's these folks.\"\n\nEarlier in her speech, Warren talked about making government work for the people.\n\n\"How do we get the change to fight back?\" she said. \"There are a lot of places where we need to be in this fight. For openers, how about we do it through the Department of Labor? How about we say we want (a National Labor Relations Board) that's actually on the side of labor? And we want whenever employers interfere with the rights of workers to organize, to bargain collectively then we want an NLRB, we want a Department of Labor that comes in on the side of the workers and puts a stop to it.\"\n\nFormer Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke was asked by moderator Steven Greenhouse how he would convince more conservative voters in his home state of Texas that a $15 an hour wage is a \"good idea.\"\n\n\"When one job is enough; when you can focus on what you're doing at work and don't have to worry about the next job or the third job that you're going to in one 24-hour period, your productivity at work is going to be so much greater,\" O'Rourke said. \"That business owner is going to get so much more out of that employee.\"\n\nO'Rourke said that in Texas, nearly half of public school educators are working a second or third job \"just to make ends meet.\"\n\n\"When everyone can just work that one job, they're going to be better at it and we will be better as a country,\" he said.\n\nHe cited his own campaign for US Senate in Texas last year as a reason why Democrats should not be afraid to take on right-to-work laws in states like Texas.\n\n\"We just ran a 254-county campaign in Texas \u2014 showed up in the most conservative, the most liberal, the smallest towns, the biggest of cities with this same message,\" O'Rourke said.\n\n\"Not only did we win more votes than any other Democrat in statewide Texas history, 500,000 of my fellow Texans who voted for Greg Abbott, a Republican tea party governor, also voted for us on the same ballot,\" O'Rourke added. \"In other words, we do not have to allow our partisan differences to define us on issues of economic opportunity and equity \u2014 whether it's in our economy or education or in health care. So, we can take on this battle and win it.\"\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also made a forceful case for a $15 per hour minimum wage, noting her own union roots and urging workers to fight against right-to-work laws not just through the courts.\n\n\"The best place we win is at the ballot box,\" she said.\n\nShe argued that the federal government should be doing more to negotiate lower drug prices through Medicare to bring down costs for everyone, as well as getting more generics on the market.\n\n\"You do it by actually bringing in drugs from less expensive countries like Canada that are safe, because I can see Canada from my porch in Minnesota, so I kind of like that,\" Klobuchar said to laughter.\n\nFormer Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who outlined a new plan for raising the minimum wage on Saturday, said he believes Democrats can win back voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania who voted for Donald Trump. The key, he said, is to \"make sure that everybody has a ladder that they should be able to work their way up and find.\"\n\n\"Those voters are waiting for us to come make a pitch, and showing them that we'll give them a better job with a better income, a better future for their kids,\" Hickenlooper said.\n\nThe former Colorado governor outlined a plan Saturday to set a nationwide minimum wage floor at $15 per hour and permanently index the minimum wage to each area's cost of living.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, noted that he is supporting the unionization of his campaign, which follows in the footsteps of the Sanders campaign.\n\n\"I'm supporting the unionization of our campaign staff who are about to unionize and we're paying even our interns $15 an hour because we believe we ought to do the right thing,\" Castro said.\n\nCNN's Annie Grayer and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

Those ideas may excite progressive activists, they said, but they risk alienating working-class voters.\n\n\"They've got to pay attention to kitchen table economics,\" said Ted Pappageorge, president of the Las Vegas Culinary Union that represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers. \"We don't quite see that.\"\n\nTerry McGowan, president of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139, in Wisconsin, said many of the issues driving the 2020 primary so far are distractions.\n\n\"The people that are into politics, the people who like sideshows, they're into that,\" he said, citing the debates over reparations for slavery and immigration as examples. \"The masses just want to feed their families.\"\n\nThe unease may be an early warning sign for Democrats, who watched as many white, working-class voters, including many union members in key Rust Belt states, chose Trump three years ago. Democrats are hoping to win back some of those voters next year, a challenge that is made harder, some argue, by labor's struggle to build its membership and influence its rank and file. Democrats' early messages may not help, some said.\n\n\"You see where some of the party's being driven. It's no secret,\" said Rusty McAllister, executive secretary of the Nevada AFL-CIO.\n\nMcAllister pointed to \"Medicare for all\" \u2014 the health care proposal of choice for several candidates \u2014 as an example of Democrats' not seizing on labor's top priorities. Many unions already organized and fought for private health insurance for their members. \"That's not something that I think that labor is as much focused on as some of the progressives are,\" McAllister said.\n\nSuch concerns \u2014 which stretched from the progressive-minded organizing halls of Nevada to the Rust Belt precincts \u2014 were typically focused on the conversation, not the candidates. The early 2020 primary has included detours into debates over the Senate filibuster, the composition of the Supreme Court and breaking up technology companies.\n\nKen Broadbent, business manager of the Pittsburgh-based Steamfitters Local 449, worried that Democrats are too focused on environmental plans like the Green New Deal, a blueprint for shifting the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels, and will neglect the importance of swing state Pennsylvania's rich natural gas deposits in creating jobs.\n\n\"Jobs is where we've got to keep things focused,\" Broadbent said.\n\nTo be sure, many unionists are excited about the presidential field. Contenders include liberal stalwarts like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign became the first in U.S. history with a unionized workforce, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who joined striking Stop & Shop workers on a picket line in Massachusetts on Friday. California Sen. Kamala Harris hired a top Service Employees International Union executive for her campaign and made her first proposal one to raise teacher's pay.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden made clear that he plans to appeal to union workers, if he gets in the race. \"You are coming back,\" he told the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers last week. \"We need you back.\"\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said the competition in the crowded field has amplified workers voices and issues.\n\nShe noted that prominent presidential candidates quickly supported Los Angeles public school teachers when they struck in January. Warren, Sanders, Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker have all proposed various taxes on higher-earning families, a departure from most past Democratic hopefuls who have treaded carefully on the issue.\n\n\"It feels different than at other times,\" Weingarten said. \"There is far more attention and focus on working people's economic needs.\"\n\nMajor endorsements are likely several months away, especially because the labor movement is treading carefully after complaints that its leadership was too quick to back Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary over Sanders.\n\nFor labor, much is at stake. Despite Republican gains, particularly with trade union members, labor remains an essential part of the Democrats' coalition. Unions spent $169 million in 2018 on federal elections, largely on Democrats' behalf, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Democrats won union workers by a strong 59%-39% margin in 2018, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate.\n\nBut other big donors and \u2014 small, online ones, too \u2014 increasingly compete with labor's organizing muscle as key to Democratic victories. Activists on a broad array of issues, from gay rights to criminal justice, compete with unions for candidates' attention. And the labor movement itself is split on its priorities, with some pushing for a focus on trade while other who represent more diverse workforces want to zoom in on immigration.\n\nAll this comes as Republicans have pushed several state laws weakening organized labor. And, last year, the Supreme Court ruled that government workers can't be forced to contribute to the unions that represent them in collective bargaining, dealing a blow to public service union's pocketbooks.\n\nAs candidates court unions for endorsements, labor leaders say they are listening for a comeback plan.\n\nAny proposal aimed at workers \"must include ensuring the opportunity to join a union, no matter where you work, since that's the best way to raise wages, improve working conditions, create family-sustaining jobs and begin to fix our rigged economy and democracy,\" said SEIU president Mary Kay Henry.\n\nAt a conference of North America's Building Trades Unions in Washington on Wednesday, several Democratic contenders talked about outlawing so-called \"right to work\" laws that prevent unions from automatically deducting dues from members, said the group's president, Sean McGarvey. But, he added, he heard \"very little about the actual structural changes to the National Labor Relations Act, or things they could put in place to give people a real free choice to join a union.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to provide the correct name of the group North America's Building Trades Unions.",

Tomorrow Oakland\u2019s Rules Committee will hear our resolution to continue to honor worker rights! #union pic.twitter.com/LKPa8mde72 \u2014 Rebecca Kaplan (@Kaplan4Oakland) June 27, 2018\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s success depends on the right of all workers \u2013 including teachers, firefighters, peace officers and nurses \u2013 to collectively negotiate fair wages, benefits and protections,\" U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement regarding the Janus v. AFSCME decision. \"The Court\u2019s decision today undermines the basic American premise, held up by courts for more than four decades, that if a union represents all employees in negotiating and administering a collective bargaining agreement, then all employees ought to share the costs of that representation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also cannot ignore that this decision is part of an ongoing trend of the Roberts Court that has repeatedly sided with employers over employees, corporations over consumers, and special interests over vulnerable Americans. Congress must act to bolster the American labor movement that built the middle class of this country. It is up to all of us to fight to protect the ability of working families to make a living wage and pursue the American dream now more than ever.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom echoed Harris' sentiments. He released this statement: \"The right of workers to organize as unions for fair wages and working conditions is a bedrock principle underpinning America's middle class. I strongly reject the reasoning underlying this ruling and California must chart its own path to strengthen the rights of workers.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, the California Nurses Association National Nurses United planned to hold a noon rally, similar to ones around the country, at the University of California San Francisco on Parnassus Avenue.\n\nAhead of the rally, the nurses said that the the \"Supreme Court decision today to roll back decades of union and worker rights in Janus v. AFSCME poses a significant threat to patient safety as well as worker and community health and economic standards.\"\n\nThe nation's largest union of registered nurses is urging Congress to reverse the decision and support the Workplace Democracy Act, introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Senate and Rep. Mark Pocan in the House to strengthen the rights of workers to form unions \u2013 and for state legislators to also act to protect the rights of workers and unions.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, \u201cwe encourage all non-union workers to join strong unions to protect their right to act collectively to advocate for themselves, their co-workers, and the public well being,\u201d said NNU Co-President Deborah Burger, who is a registered nurse.\n\n\n\nBurger added that this decision is \u201ca gift to billionaires, corporate executives and far right lobbying groups that have worked for years to destroy worker rights and unions. It also harms women and people of color who have historically had more economic opportunity in public workplaces in contrast to decades of discrimination by private employers.\u201d\n\nJanus is modeled after so-called \u201cright to work\u201d private sector laws in 28 states. In those states, median household incomes are $8,174 less than in non-right to work states, people under 65 are 46 percent more likely to be uninsured, infant mortality rates are 12 percent higher, and workplace deaths occur 49 percent more often.\n\nIn healthcare, the decision \u201cseeks to handcuff registered nurses and other public healthcare workers who challenge unsafe conditions or cuts in patient services,\u201d Burger said. \u201cNurses have seen hospitals aggressively pushing to cut corners that lead to dangerous conditions that jeopardize patient lives, as well as corporate-aligned politicians shredding public healthcare and other safety net programs.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "text": "- The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that government workers can't be forced to contribute to labor unions that represent them in collective bargaining, dealing a serious financial blow to organized labor.\n\nThe decision was immediately criticized by California Democrats and the nurses union and hailed by President Trump.\n\nTrump tweeted \"Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!\" shortly after the justices' 5-4 ruling that scrapped a 41-year-old decision allowing states to require that public employees pay some fees to unions that represent them, even if the workers choose not to join.\n\nThe ruling fulfills a longtime wish of conservatives to get rid of the so-called fair share fees that non-members pay to unions in roughly two dozen states.\n\nWhile Trump received the support of some union workers in his 2016 campaign, labor unions have largely sided with Democrats.\n\nBut the ruling did not sit well with Democrats.\n\nThe Supreme Court acted today to weaken the power of unions to fairly represent workers. Tomorrow Oakland\u2019s Rules Committee will hear our resolution to continue to honor worker rights! #union pic.twitter.com/LKPa8mde72 \u2014 Rebecca Kaplan (@Kaplan4Oakland) June 27, 2018\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s success depends on the right of all workers \u2013 including teachers, firefighters, peace officers and nurses \u2013 to collectively negotiate fair wages, benefits and protections,\" U.S. Senator Kamala D. Harris, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement regarding the Janus v. AFSCME decision. \"The Court\u2019s decision today undermines the basic American premise, held up by courts for more than four decades, that if a union represents all employees in negotiating and administering a collective bargaining agreement, then all employees ought to share the costs of that representation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also cannot ignore that this decision is part of an ongoing trend of the Roberts Court that has repeatedly sided with employers over employees, corporations over consumers, and special interests over vulnerable Americans. Congress must act to bolster the American labor movement that built the middle class of this country. It is up to all of us to fight to protect the ability of working families to make a living wage and pursue the American dream now more than ever.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom echoed Harris' sentiments. He released this statement: \"The right of workers to organize as unions for fair wages and working conditions is a bedrock principle underpinning America's middle class. I strongly reject the reasoning underlying this ruling and California must chart its own path to strengthen the rights of workers.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, the California Nurses Association National Nurses United planned to hold a noon rally, similar to ones around the country, at the University of California San Francisco on Parnassus Avenue.\n\nAhead of the rally, the nurses said that the the \"Supreme Court decision today to roll back decades of union and worker rights in Janus v. AFSCME poses a significant threat to patient safety as well as worker and community health and economic standards.\"\n\nThe nation's largest union of registered nurses is urging Congress to reverse the decision and support the Workplace Democracy Act, introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Senate and Rep. Mark Pocan in the House to strengthen the rights of workers to form unions \u2013 and for state legislators to also act to protect the rights of workers and unions.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, \u201cwe encourage all non-union workers to join strong unions to protect their right to act collectively to advocate for themselves, their co-workers, and the public well being,\u201d said NNU Co-President Deborah Burger, who is a registered nurse.\n\n\n\nBurger added that this decision is \u201ca gift to billionaires, corporate executives and far right lobbying groups that have worked for years to destroy worker rights and unions. It also harms women and people of color who have historically had more economic opportunity in public workplaces in contrast to decades of discrimination by private employers.\u201d\n\nJanus is modeled after so-called \u201cright to work\u201d private sector laws in 28 states. In those states, median household incomes are $8,174 less than in non-right to work states, people under 65 are 46 percent more likely to be uninsured, infant mortality rates are 12 percent higher, and workplace deaths occur 49 percent more often.\n\nIn healthcare, the decision \u201cseeks to handcuff registered nurses and other public healthcare workers who challenge unsafe conditions or cuts in patient services,\u201d Burger said. \u201cNurses have seen hospitals aggressively pushing to cut corners that lead to dangerous conditions that jeopardize patient lives, as well as corporate-aligned politicians shredding public healthcare and other safety net programs.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

An official said the decision comes after intelligence showed that the Iranians have loaded military equipment and missiles onto small boats controlled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard. The official was not authorized to discuss the information publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nOfficials had said earlier this week that sending a Patriot battery to the area was under discussion and was part of the initial request made by the Pentagon's U.S. Central Command. They said it took a few days to get final approval for the Patriot, a long-range, all-weather air defence system to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft.\n\nThe U.S. removed Patriot missile batteries from Bahrain, Kuwait and Jordan late last year. It was not clear if the battery would go back to one of those countries.",

Now Playing: Cars underwater near University of Houston after storms dump rain on Southeast Texas AD:\n\nRising water is an all-too-familiar sight in Houston, which has repeatedly flooded in recent years because of insufficient drainage and rapid development that reduced wetlands. Many areas hit by rain this week were evacuated during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which flooded more than 200,000 homes in the Houston area and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of being wet,\u201d said Jennifer Wilson, a homeowner who had just finished rebuilding after Harvey.\n\nWilson\u2019s home in Porter had almost 2 feet of water inside on Tuesday afternoon.

She partly blamed the new homes that had been built around her neighborhood for reducing the open land where water could otherwise flow.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re building everything up, so the water\u2019s going to go to all the subdivisions around you that are lower because it doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nCiting an abundance of caution, the Houston, Cypress-Fairbanks and Katy school districts were among three dozen local school systems that canceled classes Friday. It\u2019s unclear whether students will be required to make up the day.\n\nHouston Community College postponed its commencement from Saturday until May 17, and most Harris County courts canceled dockets and jury duty.\n\nAt one point Friday, nearly 160,000 CenterPoint Energy customers were without power. More than 62 flights were diverted to Bush Intercontinental Airport, and Southwest Airlines canceled over 90 flights from Hobby, Houston Airport System spokesperson Bill Begley said.\n\nNumerous passengers were stranded overnight.\n\n\u201cThings are a little slow; we\u2019ve had some delays,\u201d Begley said. \u201cBut nothing beyond the normal impacts on operation when you get a backlog.\u201d\n\nRain totals appeared to be highest in central and southeast Harris County over the last 24 hours, according to the flood warning system.

(Reuters)\n\nFrench commandos rescued four foreign hostages including two French citizens from a militant group in Burkina Faso, France\u2019s military said on Friday, adding that two of the elite soldiers were killed in the night-time operation.French Special Forces carried out the raid under cover of dark over the night of Thursday-Friday, supported by US intelligence and troops from France\u2019s Barkhane operation deployed in the Sahel region to counter Islamist militants. All four hostages were safe, President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said, adding that a US woman and a South Korean woman were also freed in the covert operation. \u201cThe precise and determined actions of French soldiers allowed us to take out the kidnappers while protecting the lives of the hostages,\u201d France\u2019s army chief Francois Lecointre told a news conference, describing the militant group as \u201cterrorists\u201d. Four kidnappers were killed and two escaped, he said. \u201cThose who attack France and the French know that we will spare no effort to track them and take them out. We will never abandon our citizens,\u201d Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly told reporters. The French forces had not been aware of the presence of the US and South Korean hostages ahead of the operation and they had been held for 28 days, Lecointre said. \u201cWe were not aware of their presence ... the American will be repatriated separately,\u201d Parly said. \u201cThe contacts (with those countries) show that these countries were not necessarily aware of their presence.\u201d A spokeswoman for the US State Department said the United States was grateful for the successful recovery of the hostages, including a US citizen, and offered condolences to the families of the two solders killed. \u201cThe successful operation demonstrates the importance of our historic alliance with France. We reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Burkina Faso and Benin in the face of these threats,\u201d she said. South Korea had confirmed the identity of the South Korean hostage, a woman in her 40s, its foreign ministry said. South Korea offered condolences to the families of the soldiers killed and was sincerely grateful to France for the rescue, the ministry said. France, the former colonial power in the region, intervened in Mali in 2013 against Islamist militants then occupying Mali\u2019s north and has since kept about 4,500 troops in the Sahel. The region has seen a spike in violence by militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in past years, highlighting the difficulty international partners face in restoring stability. France\u2019s defense ministry identified the fallen soldiers as two elite naval commandos. Burkina Faso\u2019s President Roch Kabore hailed the hostages\u2019 release and offered condolences to the soldiers\u2019 families. \u201cThe joint military intervention that allowed us to achieve these results shows our common engagement in fighting against the forces of evil,\u201d Kabore said in a Facebook post. Slideshow (3 Images) SPREADING INSTABILITY The two French tourists were kidnapped on May 1 in Benin\u2019s Pendjari National Park, which lies on Benin\u2019s northern frontier with Burkina Faso. Their safari guide was found dead, his body riddled with bullets, and their vehicle burned. The French government had warned its citizens against traveling to parts of Benin near the Burkina Faso border because of the risk of kidnapping. Swathes of northern and eastern Burkina Faso have been overrun by militants, leaving the government struggling to assert authority and forcing over 100,000 residents to flee. In February, Burkina Faso said militants were increasingly active in West Africa and instability in the Sahel was spreading to coastal countries such as Benin and Ivory Coast. Led by France, Western powers have also provided funding and weapons to a regional force made up of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania to combat jihadists. But the so-called G5 force has been hobbled by delays in disbursing the money and poor coordination between the five countries, while insecurity has escalated in the border region between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.\n\nRegister to advertise your products & services on our classifieds website Digger.co.ke and enjoy one month subscription free of charge and 3 free ads on the Standard newspaper.",

        "text": "Gaza City: Israeli aircraft pounded over a dozen militant targets in Gaza, the army said today, after Palestinian projectile fire shattered a ceasefire reached just days ago after the worst flare-up since a 2014 war.\n\nThe latest escalation came hours after thousands of Palestinians attended the funeral of a young female volunteer medic killed by Israeli fire in violence on the border in southern Gaza.\n\nIn a first wave of air strikes, Israeli \"fighter jets targeted 10 terror sites in three military compounds belonging to the Hamas terror organisation in the Gaza Strip,\" the army said in a statement early Sunday.\n\n\"Among the targets were two Hamas munition manufacturing and storage sites and a military compound,\" the army said.\n\nThe strikes were retaliation to rockets fired at Israel, as well as \"various terror activities approved and orchestrated by the Hamas terror organisation over the weekend,\" the army said.\n\nThe army listed a series of attempted attacks at soldiers on the border fence, as well as \"damaging security infrastructure and igniting fires in Israeli territory with the use of arson kites and balloons\".\n\nA few hours later aircraft shot at \"five terror targets at a military compound belonging to the Hamas terror organization's naval force in the northern Gaza Strip,\" the army said in a separate statement.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties in Gaza.\n\nOn Saturday evening, militants in the Palestinian enclave fired two projectiles at southern Israel, where air raid sirens sent residents to bomb shelters. The Iron Dome aerial defence system intercepted one of the projectiles, while the other was believed to have fallen short of its target and hit within Gaza, according to the army.\n\nEarly Sunday, four more projectiles were separately launched at Israel. Three were intercepted, the army said, with the fourth apparently hitting an open field.\n\nNo group in Gaza claimed responsibility for the projectile attacks, which came shortly after the Saturday funeral of Razan al-Najjar, 21, a volunteer with the Gaza health ministry, who was fatally shot in the chest near Khan Yunis on Friday.\n\nAmbulances and medical crews attended the funeral, with Najjar's father holding the white blood-stained medics' jacket she wore when she was shot, as mourners called for revenge.\n\nGazans have since March 30 staged border protests demanding the return of Palestinians to land they fled or were expelled from during the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, now inside the Jewish state.\n\nThe demonstrations have been accompanied by smaller clashes as youths hurl stones at Israeli soldiers and attempt to breach the border fence, at times laying explosive devices on the fence or throwing grenades.\n\nPalestinians in the besieged coastal enclave have also been using kites carrying burning cans to set ablaze Israeli fields, torching extensive patches of agricultural land near Gaza.\n\nFollowing the funeral, several Gazans were wounded in clashes east of Khan Yunis, health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said.\n\nThe Israeli army said \"a terror cell\" had infiltrated from southern Gaza. Soldiers shot at the Palestinians, who returned to the enclave.\n\nThe weekend launches were the first since Israel struck scores of militant sites in Gaza earlier this week in retaliation for a barrage of rockets and missiles fired from the territory.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the strikes that Israel's military had delivered the \"harshest blow\" in years to Gaza militants.\n\nPalestinian Islamist groups in Gaza, including the strip's rulers Hamas, said a ceasefire deal was reached after the flare-up, although there was no confirmation from Israel.\n\nAddressing Najjar's death, the UN envoy for the Middle East, Nickolay Mladenov, said in a Saturday tweet that \"Medical workers are #NotATarget!\" and that \"Israel needs to calibrate its use of force and Hamas need to prevent incidents at the fence.\" The Palestinian Medical Relief Society said Najjar was shot \"as she was attempting to provide first aid to an injured protester\", with three other first responders also hit by live fire on Friday.\n\n\"Shooting at medical personnel is a war crime under the Geneva conventions,\" the PMRC said in a statement, demanding \"an immediate international response to Israeli humanitarian law violations in Gaza\".\n\nNajjar's death brings the toll of Gazans killed by Israeli fire since the end of March to 123.\n\nThe demonstrations and violence peaked on May 14 when at least 61 Palestinians were killed in clashes as tens of thousands of Gazans protested the US transfer of its embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem the same day.\n\nLow-level demonstrations have continued since.\n\nSpeaking at Najjar's funeral, Khaled al-Batsh, one of the protest organisers, called on Gazans to \"continue the return marches and break the (Israeli) siege with peaceful tools\".",

The Iron Dome aerial defence system intercepted one of the projectiles, while the other was believed to have fallen short of its target and hit within Gaza, according to the army.\n\nEarly Sunday, four more projectiles were separately launched at Israel.

        "text": "Photo: GCIS/Flickr\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa addressing the 2019 Africa\u2019s Travel Indaba at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban on May 4, 2019.\n\nanalysis\n\nSouth Africa goes to the polls on May 8. The elections are gearing up to be a referendum on the ruling ANC party and whether it's done enough to rehabilitate its reputation for corruption and nepotism.\n\nTwenty-five years after the end of apartheid, South Africa's political, social and economic situation is bleak.\n\n\"There have been a number of negative developments in the country, especially in regards to the economic situation,\" says Melanie M\u00fcller, a South Africa analyst at the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).\n\nThe economy is stagnating. The national debt is worrying. Unemployment is officially at 27 percent and more than one in two young people are without jobs - all this in Africa's most industrialized economy.\n\nThe African National Congress, which swept to power in South Africa's first post-apartheid elections in 1994, is seen as playing a decisive role in the county's misery.\n\nA long list of ANC officials are accused of corruption and mismanagement that have added to the country's economic woes.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma, who was forced to step down in February 2018, has been dogged by corruption allegations. In particular, Zuma is being investigated for allowing the Indian-born Gupta family to plunder the South African state in what is known as the 'state capture inquiry.'\n\nZuma's successor Cyril Ramaphosa has promised a fresh start, presenting himself as a committed reformer, who will boost the economy and who is resolutely opposed to corruption.\n\n\"Ramaphosa has announced that he wants to fight corruption, he has also acted very quickly and replaced people in the government apparatus, who were accused of corruption,\" says M\u00fcller.\n\nThe question is whether that is enough to rebuild trust in the ANC.\n\n\"I have the impression that there are many in South Africa who would have preferred a stronger approach,\" says M\u00fcller.\n\nAnother of Ramaphosa's shortcomings is that he served as Deputy President during Zuma's last term from 2014 to 2018.\n\nOpposition senses an opportunity\n\nAnger at ongoing reports of corruption is denting faith in Ramaphosa and the ANC - something the opposition parties hope to cash in on.\n\n\"The South Africa I want to build will have no place for corruption and corrupt politicians,\" said Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) at the launch of the party manifesto.\n\nFor a long time, the DA was seen as a party of the wealthy white minority. That has changed. In recent years, the DA has rejuvenated its leadership, with Maimane the party's first black chairman.\n\nIn the 2014 elections, the Democratic Alliance won a respectable 89 seats, making it the second largest faction in parliament behind the ANC, which holds 249 seats.\n\nThe other main opposition force is the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - a far-left political party formed by the former ANC politician Julius Malema.\n\nEFF's party's manifesto advocates for the nationalization of mining companies and the redistribution of land.\n\nEFF politicians regularly attack the ruling ANC. \"They say: 'You from the ANC have brought us political and democratic freedoms but haven't guaranteed economic liberties for for most black South Africans,' says SWP expert Mueller.\n\nANC reacts to pressure\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has already announced a constitutional amendment that would allow for the expropriation of land without compensation, if necessary, to distribute land more equitably.\n\nEven decades after the end of apartheid, the majority of agricultural land is still largely in the hands of whites (even though exact calculations are hard to come by).\n\nWith the proposed constitutional amendment, the ANC is picking up a core EFF promise, even if President Ramaphosa promises cautious action.\n\nXenophobia on the rise\n\nThe issue of xenophobia is playing a major role in the current election campaign - in recent months, there have been flares of violence against migrant workers from other African countries such as Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\n\"Here in South Africa, foreigners are often seen as scapegoats,\" says Angolan journalist Ant\u00f3nio Capalandanda, who came to South Africa 10 years ago as a refugee. He says migrants in South Africa are scared and the fear has grown during the election campaign.\n\nAccording to South Africa expert M\u00fcller: \"The ANC government has criticized these attacks relatively clearly, but there are always actors who also ride a bit on this xenophobic wave is that is a similar populist campaign issue as unfortunately in Europe.\"\n\nBut Capalandanda believes the ANC was clearly responsible for the anti-migrant sentiment because the party hasn't been sufficiently opposed to xenophobia.\n\n\"President Ramaphosa's main concern is to distract from his own failures. He has spoken out against xenophobia much too late and far too little in this election campaign,\" says Capalandanda.\n\nANC still expected to emerge victorious\n\nDespite the high unemployment, economic problems and corruption, the ANC is still expected to win Wednesday's election.\n\n\"So far, most polls don't foresee an extremely large vote for other parties,\" says South Africa expert M\u00fcller.",

The elections are gearing up to be a referendum on the ruling ANC party and whether it's done enough to rehabilitate its reputation for corruption and nepotism.\n\nTwenty-five years after the end of apartheid, South Africa's political, social and economic situation is bleak.\n\n\"There have been a number of negative developments in the country, especially in regards to the economic situation,\" says Melanie M\u00fcller, a South Africa analyst at the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).\n\nThe economy is stagnating. The national debt is worrying. Unemployment is officially at 27 percent and more than one in two young people are without jobs - all this in Africa's most industrialized economy.\n\nThe African National Congress, which swept to power in South Africa's first post-apartheid elections in 1994, is seen as playing a decisive role in the county's misery.\n\nA long list of ANC officials are accused of corruption and mismanagement that have added to the country's economic woes.\n\nFormer President Jacob Zuma, who was forced to step down in February 2018, has been dogged by corruption allegations. In particular, Zuma is being investigated for allowing the Indian-born Gupta family to plunder the South African state in what is known as the 'state capture inquiry.'\n\nZuma's successor Cyril Ramaphosa has promised a fresh start, presenting himself as a committed reformer, who will boost the economy and who is resolutely opposed to corruption.\n\n\"Ramaphosa has announced that he wants to fight corruption, he has also acted very quickly and replaced people in the government apparatus, who were accused of corruption,\" says M\u00fcller.\n\nThe question is whether that is enough to rebuild trust in the ANC.\n\n\"I have the impression that there are many in South Africa who would have preferred a stronger approach,\" says M\u00fcller.\n\nAnother of Ramaphosa's shortcomings is that he served as Deputy President during Zuma's last term from 2014 to 2018.\n\nOpposition senses an opportunity\n\nAnger at ongoing reports of corruption is denting faith in Ramaphosa and the ANC - something the opposition parties hope to cash in on.\n\n\"The South Africa I want to build will have no place for corruption and corrupt politicians,\" said Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) at the launch of the party manifesto.\n\nFor a long time, the DA was seen as a party of the wealthy white minority. That has changed. In recent years, the DA has rejuvenated its leadership, with Maimane the party's first black chairman.\n\nIn the 2014 elections, the Democratic Alliance won a respectable 89 seats, making it the second largest faction in parliament behind the ANC, which holds 249 seats.\n\nThe other main opposition force is the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - a far-left political party formed by the former ANC politician Julius Malema.\n\nEFF's party's manifesto advocates for the nationalization of mining companies and the redistribution of land.\n\nEFF politicians regularly attack the ruling ANC. \"They say: 'You from the ANC have brought us political and democratic freedoms but haven't guaranteed economic liberties for for most black South Africans,' says SWP expert Mueller.\n\nANC reacts to pressure\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has already announced a constitutional amendment that would allow for the expropriation of land without compensation, if necessary, to distribute land more equitably.\n\nEven decades after the end of apartheid, the majority of agricultural land is still largely in the hands of whites (even though exact calculations are hard to come by).\n\nWith the proposed constitutional amendment, the ANC is picking up a core EFF promise, even if President Ramaphosa promises cautious action.\n\nXenophobia on the rise\n\nThe issue of xenophobia is playing a major role in the current election campaign - in recent months, there have been flares of violence against migrant workers from other African countries such as Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia.\n\n\"Here in South Africa, foreigners are often seen as scapegoats,\" says Angolan journalist Ant\u00f3nio Capalandanda, who came to South Africa 10 years ago as a refugee. He says migrants in South Africa are scared and the fear has grown during the election campaign.\n\nAccording to South Africa expert M\u00fcller: \"The ANC government has criticized these attacks relatively clearly, but there are always actors who also ride a bit on this xenophobic wave is that is a similar populist campaign issue as unfortunately in Europe.\"\n\nBut Capalandanda believes the ANC was clearly responsible for the anti-migrant sentiment because the party hasn't been sufficiently opposed to xenophobia.\n\n\"President Ramaphosa's main concern is to distract from his own failures.

The ruling African National Congress is coasting to a comfortable lead in South Africa's presidential and parliamentary elections with 80% of the vote counted, but the ongoing tally shows the party getting less support than in the previous poll five years ago. AP Photo\n\nSouth Africa's ruling African National Congress on Saturday was preparing to celebrate its win in national elections, with the formal announcement of final results coming later in the day.\n\nWith all votes counted, the ANC had 57.5%, the electoral commission said . While a win was never in doubt, it was the worst-ever showing at the polls for the party of the late Nelson Mandela which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid 25 years ago. The party won 62% of the vote in 2014.\n\nVoter turnout was another low at 65%, reflecting the frustrations of many South Africans after corruption scandals around the ANC that led former president Jacob Zuma to resign last year under party pressure. Turnout was 74% in 2014.\n\nCurrent President Cyril Ramaphosa, a Mandela protege, has vowed to clean up the rot and apologized to South Africans. But his new five-year term is threatened by Zuma allies within the ANC's leadership, who could pressure the party to oust him from power.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to Bradenton Herald content across all your devices. SAVE NOW #ReadLocal\n\nObservers have said South Africa's economy, the most developed in sub-Saharan Africa, would be further weakened if Ramaphosa is removed by his own party. He narrowly won the party leadership in late 2017, weeks before Zuma was pushed out.\n\nRamaphosa's image as a leader willing to rid the government of graft helped the ANC's showing in this election, political analyst Karima Brown said. \"It's a departure from a president who faced continuous allegations of corruption,\" she said.\n\nBut ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, seen as leading the party faction opposed to Ramaphosa, has said the victory could not be attributed to the president alone.\n\nWidespread disillusionment over the ANC and long-standing issues of high unemployment and poor delivery of basic services had been expected to give top opposition parties a boost in Wednesday's election.\n\nTop opposition party the liberal Democratic Alliance slipped in its share of votes, however, winning 20.7%, down from 22.2% in 2014. The populist Economic Freedom Fighters in just their second showing in parliamentary and presidential elections did gain ground, winning 10.7% of the vote, up from 6.3% five years ago.\n\nThe EFF won support notably among younger voters with its outspoken demands for a bigger share of South Africa's wealth from the country's white minority. It struck a chord in a country where unemployment is 27% and many in the black majority struggle to get by. The party also had promised to expropriate white-owned land without compensation and nationalize mines and banks.\n\nThe ANC barely retained control of the country's economic hub of Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria, with just over 50% of the vote.\n\nANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said the party was now focused on constituting a credible government. \"The task now is to roll up our sleeves and to sort these problems out,\" she said.\n\nIn South Africa, the president and parliament are not elected directly. The number of votes won by each party determines how many representatives are sent to the national 400-seat legislature. The president of the country is the leader of the party that gets the most votes.\n\n\"I knew that the ANC would win the elections so my vote for them did not go waste,\" said Karabo Kgole, a gas station attendant in Pretoria.",

            "text": "A young girl carries her dog as she crosses the main road, with headline from a newspaper and election posters on the streets of Soweto, South Africa, Friday, May 10, 2019. The ruling African National Congress is coasting to a comfortable lead in South Africa's presidential and parliamentary elections with 80% of the vote counted, but the ongoing tally shows the party getting less support than in the previous poll five years ago. AP Photo\n\nSouth Africa's ruling African National Congress on Saturday was preparing to celebrate its win in national elections, with the formal announcement of final results coming later in the day.\n\nWith all votes counted, the ANC had 57.5%, the electoral commission said . While a win was never in doubt, it was the worst-ever showing at the polls for the party of the late Nelson Mandela which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid 25 years ago. The party won 62% of the vote in 2014.\n\nVoter turnout was another low at 65%, reflecting the frustrations of many South Africans after corruption scandals around the ANC that led former president Jacob Zuma to resign last year under party pressure. Turnout was 74% in 2014.\n\nCurrent President Cyril Ramaphosa, a Mandela protege, has vowed to clean up the rot and apologized to South Africans. But his new five-year term is threatened by Zuma allies within the ANC's leadership, who could pressure the party to oust him from power.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to Bradenton Herald content across all your devices. SAVE NOW #ReadLocal\n\nObservers have said South Africa's economy, the most developed in sub-Saharan Africa, would be further weakened if Ramaphosa is removed by his own party. He narrowly won the party leadership in late 2017, weeks before Zuma was pushed out.\n\nRamaphosa's image as a leader willing to rid the government of graft helped the ANC's showing in this election, political analyst Karima Brown said. \"It's a departure from a president who faced continuous allegations of corruption,\" she said.\n\nBut ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule, seen as leading the party faction opposed to Ramaphosa, has said the victory could not be attributed to the president alone.\n\nWidespread disillusionment over the ANC and long-standing issues of high unemployment and poor delivery of basic services had been expected to give top opposition parties a boost in Wednesday's election.\n\nTop opposition party the liberal Democratic Alliance slipped in its share of votes, however, winning 20.7%, down from 22.2% in 2014. The populist Economic Freedom Fighters in just their second showing in parliamentary and presidential elections did gain ground, winning 10.7% of the vote, up from 6.3% five years ago.\n\nThe EFF won support notably among younger voters with its outspoken demands for a bigger share of South Africa's wealth from the country's white minority. It struck a chord in a country where unemployment is 27% and many in the black majority struggle to get by. The party also had promised to expropriate white-owned land without compensation and nationalize mines and banks.\n\nThe ANC barely retained control of the country's economic hub of Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria, with just over 50% of the vote.\n\nANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said the party was now focused on constituting a credible government. \"The task now is to roll up our sleeves and to sort these problems out,\" she said.\n\nIn South Africa, the president and parliament are not elected directly. The number of votes won by each party determines how many representatives are sent to the national 400-seat legislature. The president of the country is the leader of the party that gets the most votes.\n\n\"I knew that the ANC would win the elections so my vote for them did not go waste,\" said Karabo Kgole, a gas station attendant in Pretoria.",

Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats have blocked a Republican disaster aid bill, saying it doesn't do enough to help hurricane-torn Puerto Rico. The move tossed long-sought relief for victims of hurricanes, floods and Western wildfires into limbo.\n\nThe vote escalated a fight between Democrats and President Donald Trump, who opposes further rebuilding aid for the U.S. island territory, which was slammed by back-to-back hurricanes in 2017. Trump said Tuesday that he is the \"best thing\" that has ever happened to Puerto Rico, and claimed that additional funding for the island would come at the expense of U.S. farmers and states.\n\nMonday's 44-49 vote fell short of a majority, much less the 60 votes required to overcome a Democratic filibuster. It sent GOP leaders back to the drawing board but seemed unlikely to kill disaster aid efforts outright, since there is much political support to send aid to Southern farmers, wildfire-ravaged California towns and Midwestern flood victims.\n\nTrump allies such as Sens. David Perdue, R-Ga., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., are among the strongest backers of the legislation, which has faced significant delays.\n\n\"We will get this done eventually,\" Perdue said, promising relief to struggling farmers in his state. The path forward is not clear, but a leading option is for the Senate to pass a more narrowly drawn bill simply to get the issue into a House-Senate conference committee. House Democrats insist the talks must produce a final measure with help for Puerto Rico.\n\nThe amount of money in dispute is relatively small, but Trump feels antipathy toward Puerto Rico's government and Senate Republicans backed him up - for now - in denying Democratic demands for more aid to rebuild its badly damaged water systems and to ease the requirement that Puerto Rico financially match a portion of the federal government's aid contribution.\n\nDemocrats say Trump has been slow to release already appropriated funding for Puerto Rico and has shown little urgency in helping the island. Trump poor-mouthed the island's government at a meeting with Senate Republicans last week and suggested Puerto Rico has gotten too much disaster help compared with states such as Texas, using inflated numbers to make his case.\n\n\"Just as we leave no soldier behind on the battlefield, we help our fellow Americans when there's a disaster, wherever the disaster strikes. We do not abandon them. Period,\" said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nIn a pair of tweets Tuesday, Trump complained about the island's elected leadership and said $91 billion destined for Puerto Rico for the hurricanes is \"more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA.\"\n\n\"The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump,\" he continued. \"So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!\"\n\nThe president also criticized the island's government in a series of late-night tweets on Monday.\n\nThe $13.5 billion Senate measure mostly mirrors a $14.2 billion measure passed by the House in January, combining aid to Southern farmers, California communities devastated by last summer's wildfire, and hurricane-hit states such as Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. Hurricane-damaged military bases in Florida and North Carolina would receive rebuilding funds.\n\nDemocrats want to add almost $700 million more to unlock further disaster aid for Puerto Rico and several states, including help to rebuild badly damaged water systems. Democrats are also trying to force the administration to release billions of dollars in rebuilding funds that have already been approved.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the measure is the fastest way to get aid to the hurricane-slammed South and the badly flooded Midwest, along with nutrition aid to Puerto Rico, where food stamp benefits have already been cut.\n\n\"It's our only sure path to making a law with anywhere near the urgency these Americans deserve. It is the only bill on the table with any provision for the Midwest flooding,\" McConnell said. \"And it's the only bill on the table that could earn a presidential signature in time to deliver urgent relief on the nutrition assistance in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe political momentum for the measure - strongly backed by Trump's allies in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina, among other states - has only been heightened by massive flooding in Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Iowa, whose nominating caucuses are the first test for Democrats hoping to challenge Trump next year. The GOP measure would make Midwestern states eligible for more aid, and by blocking the bill, Democratic presidential contenders in the Senate are likely to face criticism.\n\nTrump has yet to veto a spending bill despite some tough talk, and he has signed off on $600 million to ease food stamp cuts in Puerto Rico.\n\nTrump's $91 billion estimate, said a White House spokesman, includes about $50 billion in expected future disaster disbursements, along with $41 million that's already been approved.

Helium shortage may deflate MRIs, airbags and research\n\nA global helium shortage could burst the bubble for all the businesses that rely on the gas to lift weather balloons, large blimps, and, yes, the balloons at your kid\u2019s birthday bash that make your voice sound like a chipmunk.\n\nBut the shortage is potentially deflating for a whole range of other purposes.\n\nHelium is used in deep sea diving, airbags, cryogenics, rocket fuel, MRI machines and in areas of tech that include fiber optics and semiconductors.\n\n\u201cThe shortage of helium which is present now--and which we can anticipate will increase--will affect, broadly, everybody,\u201d says Northwestern physics professor William Halperin.\n\nWashington University chemistry professor Sophia Hayes agrees. \u201cThere are so many uses beyond party balloons,\u201d she says.\n\nThe shortages gained a lot of attention Thursday after Party City announced that it would be shutting down 45 stores this year.\n\nParty City officials maintain the closings and the shortage are unrelated issues and say they are working to secure a new helium source and a contract, which is subject to final approval, would provide its stores with helium beginning this summer and continuing for several years.\n\nParty City store closings 2019: 45 locations being shuttered\n\nHelium shortage 2019: Why it's harder to throw a party and fill balloons\n\nAlthough there are long-term ramifications, experts say consumers may not feel the impact right away.\n\nMany companies that rely on helium also say they're okay \u2013 for now.\n\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber spokeswoman Emily Cropper said that while Goodyear uses helium as the lift gas in all of its famous blimps, \u201cour operations are not currently affected by the helium shortage.\u2019\u2019\n\nCorning spokesman Dan Collins says the material sciences company utilizes helium for fiber optics, primarily in the telecommunications industry. But while Corning \u201cdoes not comment on the materials used in our manufacturing process,\u2019\u2019 Collins said it \u201cis meeting all of its worldwide supply commitments for optical fiber and cable without disruption.\u2019\u2019\n\nAirbag suppliers also painted an optimistic picture for now.\n\nZF North America, the U.S. arm of a top German airbags manufacture, uses a different combination of gasses for inflators.\n\n\u201cWe do use helium, but it is a minor part of our component,\u201d maintains Tony Sapienza, head of ZF TRW North America. \u201cWe have no concerns on production with regard to helium at this time.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the world\u2019s largest supplier of airbags, Autoliv, said it also has no concerns about the helium shortage impacting its business.\n\n\u201cWe use a very small amount of helium to check for any leaks in our inflators during the test phase,\u201d spokesman Tom Hajkus says.\n\nDoctors' orders\n\nFrom the consumer perspective, you should be able to get that MRI the doctor says you need. As Hayes explains, helium shortages have been simmering for a while and hospitals, have planned in advance.\n\nBut Halperin believes smaller hospitals are more vulnerable.\n\nHayes says that the MRIs you find in a hospital rely on a closed loop system where the helium circulates, in a manner that is similar to the cooling fluid in the radiator of your car. \"The helium in such machines must only occasionally be topped off,\u201d she says.\n\nWhere the shortage may have have a bigger impact, Hayes believes, is on specialized machines similar to the MRIs in a hospital that are employed by pharmaceutical companies and chemistry departments for research.\n\nInstead of examining people and bodies, these machines, known as NMRs, examine the structure of all chemicals.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the most important machines for characterizing when you make something in a chemical lab,\" Hayes says. \"In a worldwide shortage this will become a problem someday, maybe not today.\u201d\n\nThe shortage could result in higher semiconductor costs though it remains to be seen how or even if such costs will be passed down to the consumer, much less how large any increases might be. \u201cSomeone will pay somewhere,\u201d Hayes says.\n\nWhere helium comes from\n\nHelium is extracted from natural gas mining and from the National Helium Reserve, which is set to be shut down in 2021. It was once the source of about 30% of the world's supply.\n\nThose most affected by its closure will be cryogenic users, Halperin says.\n\nOn the global stage the top suppliers are Qatar, Algeria and the U.S., with possible new sources coming from Russia, and maybe Tanzania, though Hayes says the findings are preliminary.\n\nHelium is non-renewable and at current consumption rates, it has been estimated that the supply will last another 200 years.\n\n\u201cSome of us are urging recycling of helium,\u201d Hayes says. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to do and it requires a lot of engineering and is expensive.\u201d\n\nContributing: Kelly Tyko; Randy Essex, Detroit Free Press\n\nFollow @edbaig on Twitter; @charissejones",

        "text": "The India Today Group/Getty Images\n\nPoliticians are responding to Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes' Thursday op-ed that argues the social media giant should be broken up.\n\n\"FB has become too big and too powerful, and it's part of a trend in our economy of an increasing concentration of corporate power,\" Hughes said in a tweet promoting his New York Times op-ed. \"We can fix this: break the company up and regulate it.\" Hughes left Facebook in 2007.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, voiced her support for Hughes on Twitter. Warren has been outspoken about busting up big tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook in favor of smaller businesses.\n\n\"Chris Hughes is right. Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 over our economy, our society, & our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses & stifled innovation. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,\" Warren tweeted.\n\nWin McNamee / Getty Images\n\nRep. Ro Khanna praised Hughes' essay in a tweet and agreed that Facebook shouldn't have acquired WhatsApp and Instagram in 2012.\n\n\"I believe the way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges,\" Khanna tweeted. \"The history of the Valley is the giants of the past \u2014 AOL, Yahoo, Cisco, even Microsoft \u2014 make way for the giants of the future. We need well-crafted regulation to ensure that continues.\"\n\nIn his essay, Hughes said the Federal Trade Commission made a mistake in permitting Facebook to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal echoed Hughes' statement in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. Blumenthal said the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp needed to be \"unwound\" and the Department of Justice should look into appropriate antitrust remedies.\n\n\"And let's remember, being big is not illegal. It's the misuse of that bigness and market dominance such as Facebook has been doing by acquiring innovative companies before they can really reach maturity and also copying new technologies so as to stifle competition and innovation,\" Blumenthal said in the interview.\n\nHughes said at the time of their acquisition, neither Instagram nor WhatsApp was generating meaningful revenue, but they were popular.\n\nBut Adam Mosseri, head of Facebook-owned Instagram, tweeted back at Hughes, \"Regulation is important and necessary, but I'm not convinced breaking us up is the right path.\"\n\nJames Martin\n\nFormer Wall Street Journal columnist Walt Mossberg also tweeted his support.\n\n\"I agree wholeheartedly with this blunt, smart [New York Times] op-ed by [Facebook] co-founder Chris Hughes calling for breaking up that huge, cancerous company AND regulating the remaining entities under a tough new federal privacy law,\" Mossberg said.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly with this blunt, smart @nytimes op-ed by @facebook co-founder Chris Hughes calling for breaking up that huge, cancerous company AND regulating the remaining entities under a tough new federal privacy law.https://t.co/3NqFiT4mZf? \u2014 Walt Mossberg (@waltmossberg) May 9, 2019\n\nResponding to Hughes' essay, Facebook said it accepts that success comes with accountability.\n\n\"You don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\"\n\nAyman Hariri, CEO and founder of Vero, says his social media site provides an alternative to Facebook.

        "text": "Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has added his name to the list of officials, politicians and citizens calling for the social-networking giant to be broken up due to its overwhelming size and dominance in people's everyday lives.\n\nIn an expansive opinion piece in the New York Times, Hughes cited multiple reasons why federal regulators should take the same approach to Facebook as was applied to monopolies such as Standard Oil and AT&T and split the company apart. Among those reasons Hughes mentioned were Facebook's ownership of two other popular social-media platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp, and the fact that even though Facebook is a public company, Zuckerberg's 60-percent ownership of the company's voting shares leaves him with \"unprecedented and un-American\" power to set Facebook's direction and policies.\n\n\"Mark's influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government,\" wrote Hughes. \"Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook's algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.\"\n\nIn a statement given to this news organization, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said that the company \"accepts that with success comes accountability,\" but that splitting up Facebook is not the answer to the issues that Hughes' raised in his op-ed.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to Miami Herald content across all your devices. SAVE NOW #ReadLocal\n\n\"You don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" Clegg said. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\"\n\nClegg said as an example of how serious Facebook sees its role in the social-networking space, Zuckerberg \"is meeting government leaders this week to further that work.\"\n\nHughes has a long history with Facebook. Along with Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 when the three were students at Harvard University. Hughes said in his op-ed that he hasn't worked at the company in 10 years, but that following a series of scandals involving Facebook's use of individuals personal information, security issues and a potential $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission, he feels \"a sense of anger and responsibility\" about what Facebook has become, and why it should be broken up.\n\n\"I'm worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them,\" Hughes wrote. \"The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive.\"\n\nWith his ties to Facebook, Hughes has become one of the highest-profile voices to call for the company to be broken apart. His views echo statements from advocacy groups that want the FTC to split Facebook up, and for shareholders to not vote for Zuckerberg to remain on the company's board of directors. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has also publicly said Facebook, along with Google and Amazon, should be broken up because they have \"too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\"\n\nU.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents parts of Santa Clara and Alameda Counties, said in a statement the Hughes is \"a thoughtful voice for those left out of the digital economy,\" and that \"in retrospect, the FTC should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram & WhatsApp in 2012. I believe the way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges.\"\n\nDespite his harsh words for Zuckerberg and Facebook, Hughes still called his college friend \"a good, kind person.\" But Hughes added that \"it's (Zuckerberg's) very humanity that makes his unchecked power so problematic.\"",

            "text": "Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has added his name to the list of officials, politicians and citizens calling for the social-networking giant to be broken up due to its overwhelming size and dominance in people's everyday lives.\n\nIn an expansive opinion piece in the New York Times, Hughes cited multiple reasons why federal regulators should take the same approach to Facebook as was applied to monopolies such as Standard Oil and AT&T and split the company apart. Among those reasons Hughes mentioned were Facebook's ownership of two other popular social-media platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp, and the fact that even though Facebook is a public company, Zuckerberg's 60-percent ownership of the company's voting shares leaves him with \"unprecedented and un-American\" power to set Facebook's direction and policies.\n\n\"Mark's influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government,\" wrote Hughes. \"Mark alone can decide how to configure Facebook's algorithms to determine what people see in their News Feeds, what privacy settings they can use and even which messages get delivered. He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.\"\n\nIn a statement given to this news organization, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said that the company \"accepts that with success comes accountability,\" but that splitting up Facebook is not the answer to the issues that Hughes' raised in his op-ed.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to Miami Herald content across all your devices. SAVE NOW #ReadLocal\n\n\"You don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" Clegg said. \"Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for.\"\n\nClegg said as an example of how serious Facebook sees its role in the social-networking space, Zuckerberg \"is meeting government leaders this week to further that work.\"\n\nHughes has a long history with Facebook. Along with Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, Hughes co-founded Facebook in 2004 when the three were students at Harvard University. Hughes said in his op-ed that he hasn't worked at the company in 10 years, but that following a series of scandals involving Facebook's use of individuals personal information, security issues and a potential $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission, he feels \"a sense of anger and responsibility\" about what Facebook has become, and why it should be broken up.\n\n\"I'm worried that Mark has surrounded himself with a team that reinforces his beliefs instead of challenging them,\" Hughes wrote. \"The government must hold Mark accountable. For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure that Americans are protected and markets are competitive.\"\n\nWith his ties to Facebook, Hughes has become one of the highest-profile voices to call for the company to be broken apart. His views echo statements from advocacy groups that want the FTC to split Facebook up, and for shareholders to not vote for Zuckerberg to remain on the company's board of directors. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has also publicly said Facebook, along with Google and Amazon, should be broken up because they have \"too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\"\n\nU.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents parts of Santa Clara and Alameda Counties, said in a statement the Hughes is \"a thoughtful voice for those left out of the digital economy,\" and that \"in retrospect, the FTC should not have approved Facebook's acquisition of Instagram & WhatsApp in 2012. I believe the way forward is to heavily scrutinize future mergers and to ensure no company has anti-competitive platform privileges.\"\n\nDespite his harsh words for Zuckerberg and Facebook, Hughes still called his college friend \"a good, kind person.\" But Hughes added that \"it's (Zuckerberg's) very humanity that makes his unchecked power so problematic.\"",

        "text": "By the end of 2019, many major VR headset manufacturers seem poised to launch a new \"statement\" product for PCs. This month sees two such headsets reach store shelves: the Oculus Rift S (coming May 21, priced at $400) and the HP Reverb (out now, starting at $600).\n\nIn both companies' cases, the statement from each headset is a mix of upgrade and compromise. Rift S sees Oculus take two steps forward, two steps back, from its three-year-old Rift headset to establish a new \"baseline\" PC-VR experience, particularly with active hand tracking in mind. Meanwhile, Reverb aims to deliver the most affordable \"high-res\" VR headset ever made\u2014which, as you might expect, includes a few imperfections, ranging from the obvious to the surprising.\n\nAfter living with both headsets, I can report that each headset's sales pitch is totally fine, not game-changing, and both are worth scrutinizing\u2014because neither is currently a slam-dunk recommendation.\n\nHP Reverb: You say you want resolution\n\nSam Machkovech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's start with the HP Reverb, a headset that promises to exceed the screen quality and pixel density of the already-impressive HTC Vive Pro and Samsung Odyssey. Reverb's total resolution weighs in at a combined 4,320x2,160 across its fast-switching LCD panels.\n\nAs a result, before HP agreed to send us a testing unit, we were asked to confirm a graphics card minimum of a GTX 1080 or AMD Radeon Pro WX 8200. Notice that their latter suggestion is designed for workstations, not consumer PCs. That's the point. The Reverb is squarely targeted at an enterprise or development use cases where screen quality is paramount; this is not necessarily your headset for gaming or high-speed interactivity.\n\nWeaker GPU? If you'd like to occasionally connect a high-res Reverb to a lower-than-recommended GPU, we think that's OK. Our use of a notebook-grade GTX 1070 worked in a range of popular games, but most of these automatically downgraded their resolution, anti-aliasing, or super-sampling settings. Some apps don't play as nicely, and trying to push \"normal\" settings in a visually rich game like Moss resulted in the kind of frame rate stutters that we wouldn't dream of recommending. But if that kind of lower-powered PC is your only option, we suggest more caution.\n\nThis is first made apparent by an awkward headstrap. Unlike the springy flex of the original Oculus Rift or the rotary dial of the PlayStation VR, Reverb's strap is spartan. You get three velcro straps to adjust, which are all difficult to adjust while wearing the headset. This is all bound by a light-yet-wide halo, meant to fit against the back of the head, and it comes with two decidedly cheap-feeling over-ear speakers\u2014with fuzzy material you'd expect from $5 airplane headphones. (You can't detach these, but you can push them off your ears and plug in your own headphones with a 3.5mm jack.)\n\nYet this spartan approach means the strap system is under-engineered, a rarity in the sector. The headset is substantially lighter in mass than the over-engineered Vive Pro, which may be worth some inconvenience. Its back-halo design keeps more weight off your face than the original Rift. Plus, fit it onto your exact head shape once, and it's simple enough to put on and take off from there.\n\nThe Reverb's flip-up functionality is flimsy and bumps into your head, so it disappoints as a \"peek at the outside world\" option. Its cramped interior is not particularly glasses-friendly. And if your interpupillary distance (IPD) measures outside the \"average\" measure of 61-66mm, Reverb's \"digital IPD\" adjustment option will leave you unsatisfied from a comfort level.\n\nAll of which is to say: If your expected business/enterprise use case includes mostly VR-savvy professionals of a perfect head shape and size, you'll be fine. If you're handing these to a variety of utter VR newbies, on the other hand, be ready to on-board them just to get the thing on.\n\nSweet spot, not-so-sweet result\n\nAs for the Reverb's screens, the pixel resolution of 4,320x2,160 is incredible for the sector, well past the 2,800x1,600 measure of the Vive Pro and Odyssey. (And that's even more than the Rift S, which we'll get to.)\n\nReverb's \"sweet spot\" visibility, in the center of a user's field of vision (FOV), is the absolute winner in its price sector. After roughly one week of Reverb testing, I'm now convinced that this is the pixel count to count as \"good enough\" if you want to guarantee unobtrusive small-text legibility for the sake of VR's research, education, and industrial design apps. (In Reverb's case, this selling point is buoyed by the LCD panels' dense subpixel resolution and 90Hz refresh.)\n\nHP provided some sample \"professional\" apps during my testing period, and after wandering through a virtual replica of Helsinki and dissecting a frog in a classroom, I understood why. With my attention focused on front-and-center content, I could see the Reverb's sales pitch damned clearly. HP has crossed an important VR-quality line at a reasonable business price point in 2019, and the rest of this review's caveats and warnings can't erase that fact.\n\nOne of those caveats, however, is my use of \"sweet spot\" as a qualifier. I struggled to understand why the high-res panel, all-in-all, looked a bit smeary (\"a bit\" is not a very scientific descriptor, after all). That issue became clearer once I set up a \"VR desk\" of a headset, a single hand-controlled WMR controller, a physical keyboard, and a floating VR replica of my PC's 2D desktop.\n\nDoing this confirmed my suspicions: the HP Reverb, like many other VR headsets, offers a clear view in its central FOV but is less successful at translating its peripheral pixels. Trying to read text in the periphery was a struggle compared to the same text appearing front-and-center. This was particularly easy to notice as I examined details spread across 16:9-ratio desktop windows and Web browsers. Without a physical IPD slider to work with, and only a \"virtual\" IPD adjustment option, I had no idea how to remedy this apparent blurriness. Countless attempts to re-fit the headset didn't help.\n\nTo be fair, the fact that I could comfortably read Windows desktop content is its own VR revelation. That's almost impossible to comfortably do on the first wave of 2016 VR headsets. But the Reverb's arrangement of pixels and lenses does no favors to peripheral-view content, which leads to an uncanny valley-like issue: once some of the content is so damned crisp, why can't all of it be? Additionally, why must the headset be so demanding of PC hardware if it blurs its peripheral pixels by default?\n\nSome headset manufacturers are toying with foveated rendering, which reduces pixel resolution depending on what's being displayed or how a user's eyes are tracked. But nothing so efficient is happening here. The Reverb instead renders, then wastes, at least one fourth of its pixels, which I can tell by budging the headset awkwardly around until only its corner pixels become clear.\n\nLCD concerns\n\nThat divide in clarity means all the comfort you might hope for from a higher-res headset dwindles in longer-term use. This is a shame because the fast-switching LCD panel lives up to a 90Hz refresh with fuller subpixel resolution than comparable OLED panels. However, the \"halo\" effect from its fresnel lenses is particularly noticeable within this headset.\n\nAdditionally, HP's choice of fast-switching LCD panels means the Reverb simply suffers from imprecise color calibration\u2014at least, compared to the rich, RGB-perfect results you can expect from a calibrated OLED panel. Part of that Vive Pro $1,100 price tag is an understanding that whatever content you bring in will enjoy nearly uniform color reproduction. But the Reverb's \"cold\" blue-green wash, which is nigh indiscernible when looking at a standard CMYK color sheet, becomes apparent across a wider scene, particularly the pastoral, faux-outdoor environs of the hub spaces in Windows Mixed Reality and SteamVR.\n\nIn VR experiences that rely on moody color mapping (like the storybook-adventure of Moss), the color reproduction borders on problematic. Everything in that game looks darker and less alive than on the OLED-fueled HTC Vive Pro. A visible \"mura\" effect on our testing headsets resulted in uneven color reproduction across wide fields of pixels, as well. It was arguably the most intense mura effect I've ever seen on a consumer-grade VR headset, in fact. (To best explain this, think of a large website background color, which is supposed to be totally uniform, having an uneven smudginess to it. Next, imagine that smudginess moving in relation to where your head is aimed in VR.)\n\nThe usual Windows Mixed Reality caveat\n\nIf you're fine with somewhat imprecise color reproduction, high system demands, and an asterisk on Reverb's high resolution, you have one more pill to swallow: its merely adequate room-tracking powers. This is identical to most inside-out Windows Mixed Reality headsets, which rely on two forward-facing cameras and guarantee decent tracking, so long as you keep your hands generally in front of your face.\n\nThe short version: milder apps like TiltBrush and Vacation Simulator work just fine. (So did the educational apps that HP provided.) Highly active apps like Beat Saber and Space Pirate Trainer, on the other hand, have to compensate for Reverb's poorly tracked hands on a pretty regular basis\u2014as in, every 45 seconds in a high-speed Beat Saber song, a hand will noticeably disappear for a moment. Meanwhile, any games that rely on above- and behind-the-head hand action are out the window, as most WMR headsets (including the Reverb) don't have upward-facing tracking sensors.\n\nIn good news, most popular VR fare expects lighter tracking, and as a result, WMR-style tracking will work in a pinch. But if the idea of randomly disappearing hands is too VR-breaking for you, then you'll want to pony up for a fuller tracking experience.",

That issue became clearer once I set up a \"VR desk\" of a headset, a single hand-controlled WMR controller, a physical keyboard, and a floating VR replica of my PC's 2D desktop.\n\nDoing this confirmed my suspicions: the HP Reverb, like many other VR headsets, offers a clear view in its central FOV but is less successful at translating its peripheral pixels. Trying to read text in the periphery was a struggle compared to the same text appearing front-and-center. This was particularly easy to notice as I examined details spread across 16:9-ratio desktop windows and Web browsers. Without a physical IPD slider to work with, and only a \"virtual\" IPD adjustment option, I had no idea how to remedy this apparent blurriness. Countless attempts to re-fit the headset didn't help.\n\nTo be fair, the fact that I could comfortably read Windows desktop content is its own VR revelation. That's almost impossible to comfortably do on the first wave of 2016 VR headsets. But the Reverb's arrangement of pixels and lenses does no favors to peripheral-view content, which leads to an uncanny valley-like issue: once some of the content is so damned crisp, why can't all of it be? Additionally, why must the headset be so demanding of PC hardware if it blurs its peripheral pixels by default?\n\nSome headset manufacturers are toying with foveated rendering, which reduces pixel resolution depending on what's being displayed or how a user's eyes are tracked. But nothing so efficient is happening here. The Reverb instead renders, then wastes, at least one fourth of its pixels, which I can tell by budging the headset awkwardly around until only its corner pixels become clear.\n\nLCD concerns\n\nThat divide in clarity means all the comfort you might hope for from a higher-res headset dwindles in longer-term use. This is a shame because the fast-switching LCD panel lives up to a 90Hz refresh with fuller subpixel resolution than comparable OLED panels. However, the \"halo\" effect from its fresnel lenses is particularly noticeable within this headset.\n\nAdditionally, HP's choice of fast-switching LCD panels means the Reverb simply suffers from imprecise color calibration\u2014at least, compared to the rich, RGB-perfect results you can expect from a calibrated OLED panel. Part of that Vive Pro $1,100 price tag is an understanding that whatever content you bring in will enjoy nearly uniform color reproduction. But the Reverb's \"cold\" blue-green wash, which is nigh indiscernible when looking at a standard CMYK color sheet, becomes apparent across a wider scene, particularly the pastoral, faux-outdoor environs of the hub spaces in Windows Mixed Reality and SteamVR.\n\nIn VR experiences that rely on moody color mapping (like the storybook-adventure of Moss), the color reproduction borders on problematic. Everything in that game looks darker and less alive than on the OLED-fueled HTC Vive Pro. A visible \"mura\" effect on our testing headsets resulted in uneven color reproduction across wide fields of pixels, as well. It was arguably the most intense mura effect I've ever seen on a consumer-grade VR headset, in fact. (To best explain this, think of a large website background color, which is supposed to be totally uniform, having an uneven smudginess to it. Next, imagine that smudginess moving in relation to where your head is aimed in VR.)\n\nThe usual Windows Mixed Reality caveat\n\nIf you're fine with somewhat imprecise color reproduction, high system demands, and an asterisk on Reverb's high resolution, you have one more pill to swallow: its merely adequate room-tracking powers. This is identical to most inside-out Windows Mixed Reality headsets, which rely on two forward-facing cameras and guarantee decent tracking, so long as you keep your hands generally in front of your face.\n\nThe short version: milder apps like TiltBrush and Vacation Simulator work just fine. (So did the educational apps that HP provided.) Highly active apps like Beat Saber and Space Pirate Trainer, on the other hand, have to compensate for Reverb's poorly tracked hands on a pretty regular basis\u2014as in, every 45 seconds in a high-speed Beat Saber song, a hand will noticeably disappear for a moment. Meanwhile, any games that rely on above- and behind-the-head hand action are out the window, as most WMR headsets (including the Reverb) don't have upward-facing tracking sensors.\n\nIn good news, most popular VR fare expects lighter tracking, and as a result, WMR-style tracking will work in a pinch. But if the idea of randomly disappearing hands is too VR-breaking for you, then you'll want to pony up for a fuller tracking experience.",

        "authors": [],
        "publishDate": "2019-05-10 22:19:43+00:00",
        "text": "Android Q has a lot of exciting UX additions and improvements, like Dark Mode , but it also has some under-the-hood additions to help usher in the era of 5G phones . Chief among them, we learned at Google IO 2019 , are new capabilities for app developers to detect user data download speed and latency, as well as whether their connections are metered by carriers.\n\n\u201c[TechRadar saw] a phone running Android Q beta 3 load an 8K video in just over a second.\u201d\n\nHow does this help? With the massive download speed upgrades promised by 5G \u2013 up to 1Gbps, some carriers claim \u2013 users will be able to get data far more quickly than before, allowing them to load hours-long HD videos in seconds, for example.\n\nAt Google IO, Bhavin Rokad, Google\u2019s head of Android Strategy, showed TechRadar a phone running Android Q beta 3 on a local 5G network load an 8K video in just over a second, even after flipping through different time stamps. We saw the device quickly download AR animations, just like we\u2019d seen demonstrated during the keynote. And he explained how the operating system will help developers streamline their apps for 5G.\n\n1. Devs make apps seamless with more data\n\nWith Android Q, developers will have new APIs they can use to more finely detect how much data they can send to a user\u2019s device and how much latency they\u2019re experiencing.\n\nThe APIs can help devs determine whether their app should load up a small 5MB asset or a massive 100MB on the fly. With more information on connectivity, app devs can make more seamless and immersive experiences, sending assets at the right moments \u2013- something that could improve streaming media in general, but also remove a lot of hiccups in online gaming sessions.\n\n2. Devs could help users consume less data\n\nThose APIs will also let apps detect whether a user\u2019s connection is metered \u2013 like if their account can only download data up to a cap \u2013 and only send large data packages when it\u2019s appropriate (high connection, unlimited data, enough battery, and so on).\n\nThink of this like when you\u2019re sending a photo over email or text and you\u2019re asked if you want to send the original file size or one much smaller \u2013 but in this case, the app makes that decision for you. While some of these automated choices keep your phone alive longer, others could help limit how much data you consume, which is crucial if you\u2019re reaching the end of your contracted monthly cap.\n\n3. 5G connectivity visibility\n\nAndroid Q will also make it clearer when users are actually connected to a 5G network. This is a pretty straightforward perk, but it bears mentioning given how early we are in the 5G race.\n\nAnd by early, we mean nearly nonexistent.

            "text": "Android Q has a lot of exciting UX additions and improvements, like Dark Mode , but it also has some under-the-hood additions to help usher in the era of 5G phones . Chief among them, we learned at Google IO 2019 , are new capabilities for app developers to detect user data download speed and latency, as well as whether their connections are metered by carriers.\n\n\u201c[TechRadar saw] a phone running Android Q beta 3 load an 8K video in just over a second.\u201d\n\nHow does this help? With the massive download speed upgrades promised by 5G \u2013 up to 1Gbps, some carriers claim \u2013 users will be able to get data far more quickly than before, allowing them to load hours-long HD videos in seconds, for example.\n\nAt Google IO, Bhavin Rokad, Google\u2019s head of Android Strategy, showed TechRadar a phone running Android Q beta 3 on a local 5G network load an 8K video in just over a second, even after flipping through different time stamps. We saw the device quickly download AR animations, just like we\u2019d seen demonstrated during the keynote. And he explained how the operating system will help developers streamline their apps for 5G.\n\n1. Devs make apps seamless with more data\n\nWith Android Q, developers will have new APIs they can use to more finely detect how much data they can send to a user\u2019s device and how much latency they\u2019re experiencing.\n\nThe APIs can help devs determine whether their app should load up a small 5MB asset or a massive 100MB on the fly. With more information on connectivity, app devs can make more seamless and immersive experiences, sending assets at the right moments \u2013- something that could improve streaming media in general, but also remove a lot of hiccups in online gaming sessions.\n\n2. Devs could help users consume less data\n\nThose APIs will also let apps detect whether a user\u2019s connection is metered \u2013 like if their account can only download data up to a cap \u2013 and only send large data packages when it\u2019s appropriate (high connection, unlimited data, enough battery, and so on).\n\nThink of this like when you\u2019re sending a photo over email or text and you\u2019re asked if you want to send the original file size or one much smaller \u2013 but in this case, the app makes that decision for you. While some of these automated choices keep your phone alive longer, others could help limit how much data you consume, which is crucial if you\u2019re reaching the end of your contracted monthly cap.\n\n3. 5G connectivity visibility\n\nAndroid Q will also make it clearer when users are actually connected to a 5G network. This is a pretty straightforward perk, but it bears mentioning given how early we are in the 5G race.\n\nAnd by early, we mean nearly nonexistent. When we tested the first 5G US network in Chicago earlier this year, we couldn\u2019t always tell when we were accessing the then-piecemeal 5G network.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about getting those high speeds \u2013 it\u2019s knowing when you\u2019re getting them so you can comfortably send that big file or play a data-hungry game without wondering about your connection.\n\nCarriers, 5G, and the unknown\n\nBut the data flow coming to the APIs requires some coordination with carriers, who must agree to pass along this info to developers. Google is still negotiating with carriers to grant this access \u2013 not, we understand, because they want to withhold this information, but because they haven\u2019t had a strong motivation to do so.\n\nUnderstandably, users won\u2019t see these 5G features for awhile \u2013 especially since the 5G networks themselves have only just started launching in very small areas. The US saw its first network go live in April, and we found it to have erratic coverage in a small area with sometimes-high speeds.\n\nUS carriers have claimed their networks will start going live and expanding throughout 2019, but we\u2019ll wait to see how much speed and coverage they deliver \u2013 and how much they\u2019ll cost. Verizon initially charged $10 extra to access its 5G network, though they\u2019re waiving that cost for now, presumably to encourage adoption (and offset the price of 5G-capable phones).\n\nThe other question: what kinds of data caps users will have, and how much they\u2019ll have to pay for them. These factors could seriously impact how developers implement these 5G APIs \u2013 will they need to limit the size of their assets anyway to make sure users don\u2019t consume too much data, or will users just end up buying bigger data caps?\n\nThose unknowns will affect how developers build apps harnessing 5G connectivity, from back-end prioritization to giving users toggle options for controlling their data consumption.

        "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Japan has started testing its fastest-ever bullet train -- capable of reaching 400 kilometers per hour (249 mph) -- as it continues to develop the revolutionary mode of travel\n\nThe ALFA-X version of the Shinkansen train began three years' worth of test runs on Friday.\n\nOnce it enters operation sometime around 2030, it will run at speeds of up to 360 kph (224 mph), comfortably making it the world's fastest bullet train.\n\nIt will also outpace China's Fuxing train, which runs at 10 kph slower despite being designed with the same top speed capabilities as the ALFA-X.\n\nThe model will operate at speeds of up to 360 km/h.\n\nThe model's futuristic design features 10 cars and a long pointed nose.\n\nIt'll be tested on the line between the cities of Sendai and Aomori, which are about 280 kilometers apart as the crow flies. Tests will take place after midnight, when the line is quiet, and will occur twice a week.\n\nThe ALFA-X marks a new stage of growth for the Shinkansen, pushing the world-renowned high speed rail service even faster towards the future.\n\nIts testing debut comes as Japan's new high-speed Shinkansen N700S continues tests that began just over a year ago.\n\nThat model will enter operation in 2020, but its maximum speeds of 300 kph -- the same as other N700 series trains -- will be easily surpassed by the ALFA-X.\n\nThe flurry of new models coincides with Japan's preparations to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.",

        "text": "By Chao Deng\n\nBEIJING -- China held back from immediate retaliation for higher U.S. tariffs, unlike in past rounds, taking time to weigh its options amid uncertainty over how the Chinese economy would weather a full-bore trade conflict.\n\nA failure to break an impasse in talks in Washington on Friday opened a new phase in the trade fight after more than five months of back-and-forth negotiations. This time, some economists and analysts said, Beijing is taking stock of potential economic damage from higher tariffs.\n\nThe U.S. raised punitive tariffs to 25%, from 10%, for $200 billion in goods leaving China on Friday and thereafter. President Trump also ordered staff to begin the paperwork to impose levies on the more than $300 billion worth of everything else China sells to the U.S.\n\nWhile Beijing has met previous volleys of tariffs from the U.S. by raising duties on American goods -- and the government has promised to retaliate -- it held its fire. Though China has more limited tariff options, since it imports fewer products from the U.S. than the other way around, the Chinese leadership is also constrained by an economy that is in a shaky recovery from a sharp slowdown.\n\nThe tariff escalation is worrisome for Chinese officials, who are watching potential ripple effects, from weakening of the currency to crimping future foreign investment. Raising existing tariffs or imposing new ones could hit products China's economy needs, like semiconductors, pork, oil and passenger jets.\n\nA wider-scale trade conflict could also force Beijing to further ease credit and boost government spending to shore up growth, doubling down on the stimulus used last year at a time some analysts say it should be ratcheting back such measures.\n\n\"China doesn't want to fan the flames,\" Mark Wu, an international trade professor at Harvard University, says. \"It wants to be seen as the reasonable party and open to compromise.\"\n\nChina's lead negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, told Chinese reporters before leaving Washington that the domestic economy is in better shape than last year, with sufficient policy tools and business confidence to withstand pressure and \"maintain smooth, healthy development.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Friday's impasse, Mr. Liu stressed that negotiations haven't broken down -- a message amplified by state media. Rather, according to video clips posted online by state media, Mr. Liu said negotiations \"encountered unavoidable complications\" and the two sides have agreed to meet in Beijing in the future.\n\nNegotiations between the U.S. and China seemed to be heading toward an agreement earlier this month when, according to Mr. Trump and U.S. officials, Beijing backtracked on commitments made in earlier rounds. Those included listing specific laws in the agreement that China would change covering intellectual property protection, subsidies and forced technology transfers, according to people in the U.S. and China following the talks.\n\nMr. Liu, in remarks reported by the Hong Kong news site Phoenix New Media Limited, didn't specify what caused the negotiations to founder. He disagreed that the Chinese side backtracked, saying in any negotiation changes are natural before a final agreement is reached.\n\nHow Beijing moves ahead in coming weeks is likely to depend on its reading of the economy and on the U.S.'s willingness to negotiate, the economists and analysts said.\n\n\"The most important thing is to not appear weak and cave into the U.S.,\" says Arthur Krober, founding partner at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. A likely scenario for Beijing, he says, is to \"look like you're staying the course, offer some discreet support if necessary, [and] hope they can get this thing resolved in next month.\"\n\nThe higher U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will slow China's economy by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points this year, according to Barclays Research. Fresh 25% levies on the remaining $325 billion in Chinese goods could further drag down growth by up to 0.5 percentage points in the next 12 months, after tariffs go into effect, it said.\n\n\"The moment Trump announces a date for tariffs on all Chinese goods, that's the moment the yuan will drop,\" says Bo Zhuang, an economist at research firm TS Lombard. He estimates authorities would allow the currency to swing to as weak as 7.6 yuan to the U.S. dollar, a level that would roughly offset the impact of 25% tariffs on all Chinese imports.\n\nIn the next few weeks, China watchers think the leadership will hold back from drastic moves such as reducing banks required reserves to give them more money to lend. Though the two sides haven't set a date to resume talks, President Xi Jinping and Mr. Trump are both scheduled to attend a Group-of-20 meeting in Japan at the end of June, giving negotiators a target to work toward.\n\nFor now, Beijing has only hinted at more stimulus. The central bank on Monday announced a small cut to the amount of reserves certain banks have to keep with it, a show of policy support just after the U.S. threatened tariffs. On Friday, central bank deputy director Zou Wei said in a media briefing that financial support for the property sector would be stable this year.\n\nPreviously, Beijing had been expected to ease up on stimulus after the economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 6.4% in the first quarter. Now, \"Beijing cannot afford to roll back stimulus,\" said Lombard's Mr. Zhuang. \"They'll have to continue to boost to make less concessions in the trade deal.\"\n\n-- Chunying Zhang contributed to this article\n\nWrite to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com",

        "text": "Justin Sullivan, Getty Images, AFP | A shipping container is offloaded from the Hong Kong based CSCL East China Sea container ship at the Port of Oakland in California on June 20, 2018.\n\nU.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports took effect as a deadline passed on Friday, and with Beijing having vowed to respond immediately in kind, the world\u2019s two biggest economies took a high-stakes turn towards all-out trade conflict.\n\nADVERTISING Read more\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry said in a statement shortly after the deadline passed that it was forced to retaliate, meaning $34 billion worth of imported U.S. goods including autos and agricultural products also faced 25 percent tariffs.\n\n\u201cChina promised to not fire the first shot, but to defend national core interests and the interests of the people it has no choice but to strike back as necessary,\u201d the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe ministry called the U.S. actions \u201ca violation of world trade rules\u201d and said that it had \u201cinitiated the largest-scale trade war in economic history.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount that the United States imported from China last year.\n\nChinese shares, which have been battered in the run-up to the tariff deadline, were down in choppy trade but recovered from earlier lows, while the yuan currency also weakened. Asian equities wobbled amid nervous trading.\n\n\u201cWe can probably say that the trade war has officially started,\u201d said Chen Feixiang, professor of applied economics at Shanghai Jiaotong University\u2019s Antai Colege of Economics and Management.\n\n\u201cIf this ends at $34 billion, it will have a marginal effect on both economies, but if it escalates to $500 billion like Trump said then it\u2019s going to have a big impact for both countries,\u201d Chen said.\n\n\u2018Gang of hoodlums'\n\nTrump has railed against Beijing for intellectual property theft and barriers to entry for U.S. businesses and a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China.\n\nThroughout the escalating conflict, China has sought to take the high road, positioning itself as a champion of free trade, but state media ramped-up criticism of Trump on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn effect, the Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China,\u201d the state-run China Daily newspaper said in an English language editorial on Friday.\n\n\u201cIts unruliness looks set to have a profoundly damaging impact on the global economic landscape in the coming decades, unless countries stand together to oppose it.\u201d\n\nWhile the initial volley of tariffs was not expected to have major immediate economic impact, the fear is that a prolonged battle would disrupt makers and importers of affected goods in a blow to global trade, investment and growth.\n\n\u201cFor companies with supply exposure to tariffs, they will move sourcing country of origin if they can; if they can\u2019t, they\u2019ll pass on as much of the tariff cost as they can, or see a cut in margins,\u201d said Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing.\n\n\u201cCompanies don\u2019t know how big this may get, or how it will end.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Ford Motor Co said that for now, it will not hike prices of imported Ford and higher-margin luxury Lincoln models in China.\n\nA China central bank adviser said the planned U.S. import tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods - $34 billion plus a planned follow-on list worth $16 billion - will cut China\u2019s economic growth by 0.2 percentage points, although the overall impact would be limited, the official Xinhua news agency reported Friday.\n\nThe dispute has roiled financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal in recent weeks. U.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday, however, amid hopes that American trade tensions with Europe may ease after comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\u201cThis is not economic Armageddon. We will not have to hunt our food with pointy sticks. But it is applying the brakes to a global economy that has less durable momentum than appears to be the case,\u201d Rob Carnell, chief economist at ING, said in a note to clients.\n\nValves and disk drives\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials were due to collect 25 percent duties on a range of products including motor vehicles, computer disk drives, parts of pumps, valves and printers and many other industrial components.\n\nThe list avoids direct tariffs on consumer goods such as cellphones and footwear. But some products, including thermostats, are lumped into intermediate and capital goods categories.\n\nChinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday that the proposed U.S. tariffs would hit many American and foreign companies operating in China and disrupt their supplies of components and assembly work.\n\nForeign companies accounted for $20 billion, or 59 percent, of the $34 billion of exports from China that would be subject to new U.S. tariffs, with U.S. firms accounting for a significant part of that 59 percent, Gao said.\n\nChina\u2019s tariffs on hundreds of U.S. goods include top exports such as soybeans, sorghum and cotton, threatening U.S. farmers in states that backed Trump in the 2016 U.S. election, such as Texas and Iowa.\n\n(REUTERS)",

            "text": "Justin Sullivan, Getty Images, AFP | A shipping container is offloaded from the Hong Kong based CSCL East China Sea container ship at the Port of Oakland in California on June 20, 2018.\n\nU.S. tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports took effect as a deadline passed on Friday, and with Beijing having vowed to respond immediately in kind, the world\u2019s two biggest economies took a high-stakes turn towards all-out trade conflict.\n\nADVERTISING Read more\n\nChina\u2019s commerce ministry said in a statement shortly after the deadline passed that it was forced to retaliate, meaning $34 billion worth of imported U.S. goods including autos and agricultural products also faced 25 percent tariffs.\n\n\u201cChina promised to not fire the first shot, but to defend national core interests and the interests of the people it has no choice but to strike back as necessary,\u201d the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe ministry called the U.S. actions \u201ca violation of world trade rules\u201d and said that it had \u201cinitiated the largest-scale trade war in economic history.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that the United States may ultimately target over $500 billion worth of Chinese goods, or roughly the total amount that the United States imported from China last year.\n\nChinese shares, which have been battered in the run-up to the tariff deadline, were down in choppy trade but recovered from earlier lows, while the yuan currency also weakened. Asian equities wobbled amid nervous trading.\n\n\u201cWe can probably say that the trade war has officially started,\u201d said Chen Feixiang, professor of applied economics at Shanghai Jiaotong University\u2019s Antai Colege of Economics and Management.\n\n\u201cIf this ends at $34 billion, it will have a marginal effect on both economies, but if it escalates to $500 billion like Trump said then it\u2019s going to have a big impact for both countries,\u201d Chen said.\n\n\u2018Gang of hoodlums'\n\nTrump has railed against Beijing for intellectual property theft and barriers to entry for U.S. businesses and a $375 billion U.S. trade deficit with China.\n\nThroughout the escalating conflict, China has sought to take the high road, positioning itself as a champion of free trade, but state media ramped-up criticism of Trump on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn effect, the Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China,\u201d the state-run China Daily newspaper said in an English language editorial on Friday.\n\n\u201cIts unruliness looks set to have a profoundly damaging impact on the global economic landscape in the coming decades, unless countries stand together to oppose it.\u201d\n\nWhile the initial volley of tariffs was not expected to have major immediate economic impact, the fear is that a prolonged battle would disrupt makers and importers of affected goods in a blow to global trade, investment and growth.\n\n\u201cFor companies with supply exposure to tariffs, they will move sourcing country of origin if they can; if they can\u2019t, they\u2019ll pass on as much of the tariff cost as they can, or see a cut in margins,\u201d said Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing.\n\n\u201cCompanies don\u2019t know how big this may get, or how it will end.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Ford Motor Co said that for now, it will not hike prices of imported Ford and higher-margin luxury Lincoln models in China.\n\nA China central bank adviser said the planned U.S. import tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods - $34 billion plus a planned follow-on list worth $16 billion - will cut China\u2019s economic growth by 0.2 percentage points, although the overall impact would be limited, the official Xinhua news agency reported Friday.\n\nThe dispute has roiled financial markets including stocks, currencies and the global trade of commodities from soybeans to coal in recent weeks. U.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday, however, amid hopes that American trade tensions with Europe may ease after comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\n\u201cThis is not economic Armageddon. We will not have to hunt our food with pointy sticks. But it is applying the brakes to a global economy that has less durable momentum than appears to be the case,\u201d Rob Carnell, chief economist at ING, said in a note to clients.\n\nValves and disk drives\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials were due to collect 25 percent duties on a range of products including motor vehicles, computer disk drives, parts of pumps, valves and printers and many other industrial components.\n\nThe list avoids direct tariffs on consumer goods such as cellphones and footwear. But some products, including thermostats, are lumped into intermediate and capital goods categories.\n\nChinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said on Thursday that the proposed U.S. tariffs would hit many American and foreign companies operating in China and disrupt their supplies of components and assembly work.\n\nForeign companies accounted for $20 billion, or 59 percent, of the $34 billion of exports from China that would be subject to new U.S. tariffs, with U.S. firms accounting for a significant part of that 59 percent, Gao said.\n\nChina\u2019s tariffs on hundreds of U.S. goods include top exports such as soybeans, sorghum and cotton, threatening U.S. farmers in states that backed Trump in the 2016 U.S. election, such as Texas and Iowa.\n\n(REUTERS)",
